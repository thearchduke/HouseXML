<subsection><header>Federal renewable electricity credits</header> 
<paragraph><header>In general</header><text>The regulations promulgated under this section shall include provisions governing the issuance, tracking, and verification of Federal renewable electricity credits. Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection, the Commission shall issue to each generator of renewable electricity, 1 Federal renewable electricity credit for each megawatt hour of renewable electricity generated by such generator after December 31, 2011. The Commission shall assign a unique serial number to each Federal renewable electricity credit.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Generation from certain State renewable electricity programs</header><text>(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), where renewable electricity is generated with the support of payments from a retail electric supplier pursuant to a State renewable electricity program (whether through State alternative compliance payments or through payments to a State renewable electricity procurement fund or entity), the Commission shall issue Federal renewable electricity credits to such retail electric supplier for the proportion of the relevant renewable electricity generation that is attributable to the retail electric supplier’s payments, as determined pursuant to regulations issued by the Commission. For any remaining portion of the relevant renewable electricity generation, the Commission shall issue Federal renewable electricity credits to the generator, as provided in paragraph (1), except that in no event shall more than 1 Federal renewable electricity credit be issued for the same megawatt hour of electricity. In determining how Federal renewable electricity credits will be apportioned among retail electric suppliers and generators in such circumstances, the Commission shall consider information and guidance furnished by the relevant State or States.</text> 
<subparagraph><text> In the case of a central procurement State that pursuant to subsection (g) has assumed responsibility for compliance with the requirements of subsection (b), the Commission shall issue directly to the State Federal renewable electricity credits for any renewable electricity for which the State, pursuant to a mandate described in subsection (a)(7), has centrally procured credits or certificates issued based on generation of such renewable electricity.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Certain power sales contracts</header><text>Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2), when a generator has sold renewable electricity to a retail electric supplier under a contract for power from a facility placed in service before the date of enactment of this section, and the contract does not provide for the determination of ownership of the Federal renewable electricity credits associated with such generation, the Commission shall issue such Federal renewable electricity credits to the retail electric supplier for the duration of the contract.</text> </paragraph>

<subparagraph><header>Adjustment</header><text>Except as provided in subparagraph (C), not later than January 1, 2014, and not less frequently than every 4 years thereafter, the Commission shall review the effect of this paragraph and shall, as necessary, reduce the number of Federal renewable electricity credits per megawatt hour issued under this paragraph for any given energy source or technology, but not below 1, to ensure that such number is no higher than the Commission determines is necessary to make distributed renewable generation facilities using such source or technology cost competitive with other sources of renewable electricity generation.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Facilities placed in service after enactment</header><text>For any distributed renewable generation facility placed in service after the date of enactment of this section, subparagraph (B) shall not apply for the first 10 years after the date on which the facility is placed in service. For each year during such 10-year period, the Commission shall issue to the facility the same number of Federal renewable electricity credits per megawatt hour as are issued to that facility in the year in which such facility is placed in service. After such 10-year period, the Commission shall issue Federal renewable electricity credits to the facility in accordance with the current multiplier as determined pursuant to subparagraph (B).</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Credits based on qualified hydropower</header><text>For purposes of this subsection, the number of Federal renewable electricity credits issued for qualified hydropower shall be calculated—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>based solely on the increase in average annual generation directly resulting from the efficiency improvements or capacity additions described in subsection (a)(13)(A); and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>using the same water flow information used to determine a historic average annual generation baseline for the hydroelectric facility, as certified by the Commission.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Generation from qualified waste-to-energy</header><text>In the case of electricity generated from the combustion of any municipal solid waste or construction, demolition, or disaster debris that is included in the definition of renewable biomass, or from the gasification or pyrolization of such waste or debris and the combustion of the resulting gas at the same facility, the Commission shall issue Federal renewable electricity credits only for electricity generated from qualified waste-to-energy.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Generation from mixed renewable and nonrenewable resources</header><text>If electricity is generated using both a renewable energy resource or other qualifying energy resource and an energy source that is not a renewable energy resource or other qualifying energy resource (as, for example, in the case of co-firing of renewable biomass and fossil fuel), the Commission shall issue Federal renewable electricity credits based on the proportion of the electricity that is attributable to the renewable energy resource or other qualifying energy resource.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Prohibition against double-counting</header><text>Except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, the Commission shall ensure that no more than 1 Federal renewable electricity credit will be issued for any megawatt hour of renewable electricity and that no Federal renewable electricity credit will be used more than once for compliance with this section.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Trading</header><text>The lawful holder of a Federal renewable electricity credit may sell, exchange, transfer, submit for compliance in accordance with subsection (b), or submit such credit for retirement by the Commission.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Banking</header><text>A Federal renewable electricity credit may be submitted in satisfaction of the compliance obligation set forth in subsection (b) for the compliance year in which the credit was issued or for any of the 3 immediately subsequent compliance years. The Commission shall retire any Federal renewable electricity credit that has not been retired by April 2 of the calendar year that is 3 years after the calendar year in which the credit was issued.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Retirement</header><text>The Commission shall retire a Federal renewable electricity credit immediately upon submission by the lawful holder of such credit, whether in satisfaction of a compliance obligation under subsection (b) or on some other basis.</text></paragraph></subsection>

<paragraph><header>Audit</header><text>ERCOT shall provide a copy of its annual audit pertaining to the administration of the provisions of this subsection to the Corporation.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Definitions</header><text>For the purposes of this subsection:</text> 
<subparagraph><text>The term “ERCOT” means the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>The term “load-serving entities” has the meaning adopted by ERCOT Protocols and in effect on the date of enactment of this Act.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>The term “qualified scheduling entities” has the meaning adopted by ERCOT Protocols and in effect on the date of enactment of this Act.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>The term “renewable energy credit” has the meaning as promulgated and adopted by the Public Utility Commission of Texas pursuant to section 39.904(b) of the Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1999, and in effect on the date of enactment of this Act.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Determination of fossil fuel-based electricity deliveries</header> 
<paragraph><header>Findings</header><text>The Congress finds that:</text> 
<subparagraph><text>The assessments under subsection (d) are to be collected based on the amount of fossil fuel-based electricity delivered by each distribution utility.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>Since many distribution utilities purchase all or part of their retail consumer’s electricity needs from other entities, it may not be practical to determine the precise fuel mix for the power sold by each individual distribution utility.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>It may be necessary to use average data, often on a regional basis with reference to Regional Transmission Organization (<quote>RTO</quote>) or NERC regions, to make the determinations necessary for making assessments.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>DOE proposed rule</header><text>The Secretary, acting in close consultation with the Energy Information Administration, shall issue for notice and comment a proposed rule to determine the level of fossil fuel electricity delivered to retail customers by each distribution utility in the United States during the most recent calendar year or other period determined to be most appropriate. Such proposed rule shall balance the need to be efficient, reasonably precise, and timely, taking into account the nature and cost of data currently available and the nature of markets and regulation in effect in various regions of the country. Different methodologies may be applied in different regions if appropriate to obtain the best balance of such factors.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Final rule</header><text>Within 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, and after opportunity for comment, the Secretary shall issue a final rule under this subsection for determining the level and type of fossil fuel-based electricity delivered to retail customers by each distribution utility in the United States during the appropriate period. In issuing such rule, the Secretary may consider opportunities and costs to develop new data sources in the future and issue recommendations for the Energy Information Administration or other entities to collect such data. After notice and opportunity for comment the Secretary may, by rule, subsequently update and modify the methodology for making such determinations.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Annual determinations</header><text>Pursuant to the final rule issued under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall make annual determinations of the amounts and types for each such utility and publish such determinations in the Federal Register. Such determinations shall be used to conduct the referendum under subsection (b) and by the Corporation in applying any assessment under this subsection.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Rehearing and judicial review</header><text>The owner or operator of any distribution utility that believes that the Secretary has misapplied the methodology in the final rule in determining the amount and types of fossil fuel electricity delivered by such distribution utility may seek rehearing of such determination within 30 days of publication of the determination in the Federal Register. The Secretary shall decide such rehearing petitions within 30 days. The Secretary’s determinations following rehearing shall be final and subject to judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Compliance with Corporation assessments</header><text>The Corporation may bring an action in the appropriate court of the United States to compel compliance with an assessment levied by the Corporation under this section. A successful action for compliance under this subsection may also require payment by the defendant of the costs incurred by the Corporation in bringing such action.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Midcourse review</header><text>Not later than 5 years following establishment of the Corporation, the Comptroller General of the United States shall prepare an analysis, and report to Congress, assessing the Corporation’s activities, including project selection and methods of disbursement of assessed fees, impacts on the prospects for commercialization of carbon capture and storage technologies, adequacy of funding, and administration of funds. The report shall also make such recommendations as may be appropriate in each of these areas. The Corporation shall reimburse the Government Accountability Office for the costs associated with performing this midcourse review.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Recovery of costs</header> 
<paragraph><header>In general</header><text>A distribution utility whose transmission, delivery, or sales of electric energy are subject to any form of rate regulation shall not be denied the opportunity to recover the full amount of the prudently incurred costs associated with complying with this section, consistent with applicable State or Federal law.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Ratepayer Rebates</header><text>Regulatory authorities that approve cost recovery pursuant to paragraph (1) may order rebates to ratepayers to the extent that distribution utilities are reimbursed undedicated or unassigned balances pursuant to subsection (d)(3).</text></paragraph></subsection>

<clause><text>upon implementation, will achieve an emission limit that is at least a 50 percent reduction in emissions of the carbon dioxide produced by the emission point, measured on an annual basis, determined in accordance with section 812(b)(2); and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>does not produce a liquid transportation fuel from a solid fossil-based feedstock;</text></clause></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>geologically sequester carbon dioxide at a site that meets all applicable permitting and certification requirements for geologic sequestration, or, pursuant to such requirements as the Administrator may prescribe by regulation, convert captured carbon dioxide to a stable form that will safely and permanently sequester such carbon dioxide;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>meet all other applicable State, tribal, and Federal permitting requirements; and</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>be located in the United States.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Phase I distribution to electric generating units</header> 
<paragraph><header>Application</header><text>This subsection shall apply only to projects at the first 6 gigawatts of electric generating units, measured in cumulative generating capacity of such units, that receive allowances under this section.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Distribution</header><text>The Administrator shall distribute emission allowances allocated under section 782(f) to the owner or operator of each eligible project at an electric generating unit in a quantity equal to the quotient obtained by dividing—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>the product obtained by multiplying—</text> 
<clause><text>the number of metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions avoided through capture and sequestration of emissions by the project, as determined pursuant to such methodology as the Administrator shall prescribe by regulation; and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>a bonus allowance value, pursuant to paragraph (3); by</text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>the average fair market value of an emission allowance during the preceding year.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Bonus allowance values</header> 
<subparagraph><text>For a generating unit achieving the capture and sequestration of 85 percent or more of the carbon dioxide that otherwise would be emitted by such unit, the bonus allowance value shall be $90 per ton.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>The Administrator shall by regulation establish a bonus allowance value for each rate of lower capture and sequestration achieved by a generating unit, from a minimum of $50 per ton for a 50 percent rate and varying directly with increasing rates of capture and sequestration up to $90 per ton for an 85 percent rate.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>For a generating unit that achieves the capture and sequestration of at least 50 percent of the carbon dioxide that otherwise would be emitted by such unit by not later than January 1, 2017, the otherwise applicable bonus allowance value under this paragraph shall be increased by $10, provided that the owner of such unit notifies the Administrator by not later than January 1, 2012, of its intent to achieve such rate of capture and sequestration.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>For a carbon capture and sequestration project sequestering in a geological formation for purposes of enhanced hydrocarbon recovery, the Administrator shall, by regulation, reduce the applicable bonus allowance value under this paragraph to reflect the lower net cost of the project when compared to sequestration into geological formations solely for purposes of sequestration.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>The Administrator shall annually adjust for inflation the bonus allowance values established under this paragraph.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Phase II distribution to electric generating units</header> 
<paragraph><header>Application</header><text>This subsection shall apply only to the distribution of emission allowances for carbon capture and sequestration projects at electric generating units after the capacity threshold identified in subsection (c)(1) is reached.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Regulations</header><text>Not later than 2 years prior to the date on which the capacity threshold identified in subsection (c)(1) is projected to be reached, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations to govern the distribution of emission allowances to the owners or operators of eligible projects under this subsection.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Reverse auctions</header> 
<subparagraph><header>In general</header><text>Except as provided in paragraph (4), the regulations promulgated under paragraph (2) shall provide for the distribution of emission allowances to the owners or operators of eligible projects under this subsection through reverse auctions, which shall be held no less frequently than once each calendar year. The Administrator may establish a separate auction for each of no more than 5 different project categories, defined on the basis of coal type, capture technology, geological formation type, new unit versus retrofit application, such other factors as the Administrator may prescribe, or any combination thereof. The Administrator may establish appropriate minimum rates of capture and sequestration in implementing this paragraph.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Auction process</header><text>At each reverse auction—</text> 
<clause><text>the Administrator shall solicit bids from eligible projects;</text></clause> 
<clause><text>eligible projects participating in the auction shall submit a bid including the desired level of carbon dioxide sequestration incentive per ton and the estimated quantity of carbon dioxide that the project will permanently sequester over 10 years; and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>the Administrator shall select bids, within each auction, for the sequestration amount submitted, beginning with the eligible project submitting the bid for the lowest level of sequestration incentive on a per ton basis and meeting such other requirements as the Administrator may specify, until the amount of funds available for the reverse auction is committed.</text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Form of distribution</header><text>The Administrator shall distribute emission allowances to the owners or operators of eligible projects selected through a reverse auction under this paragraph pursuant to a formula equivalent to that described in subsection (c)(2), except that the bonus allowance value that is bid by the entity shall be substituted for the bonus allowance values set forth in subsection (c)(3).</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Alternative distribution method</header> 
<subparagraph><header>In general</header><text>If the Administrator determines that reverse auctions would not provide for efficient and cost-effective commercial deployment of carbon capture and sequestration technologies, the Administrator may instead, through regulations promulgated under paragraph (2) or (5), prescribe a schedule for the award of bonus allowances to the owners or operators of eligible projects under this subsection, in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Multiple tranches</header><text>The Administrator shall divide emission allowances available for distribution to the owners or operators of eligible projects into a series of tranches, each supporting the deployment of a specified quantity of cumulative electric generating capacity utilizing carbon capture and sequestration technology, each of which shall not be greater than 6 gigawatts.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Method of distribution</header><text>The Administrator shall distribute emission allowances within each tranche, on a first-come, first-served basis—</text> 
<clause><text>based on the date of full-scale operation of capture and sequestration technology; and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>pursuant to a formula, similar to that set forth in subsection (c)(2) (except that the Administrator shall prescribe bonus allowance values different than those set forth in subsection (c)(3)), establishing the number of allowances to be distributed per ton of carbon dioxide sequestered by the project.</text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Requirements</header><text>For each tranche established pursuant to subparagraph (B), the Administrator shall establish a schedule for distributing emission allowances that—</text> 
<clause><text>is based on a sliding scale that provides higher bonus allowance values for projects achieving higher rates of capture and sequestration;</text></clause> 
<clause><text>for each capture and sequestration rate, establishes a bonus allowance value that is lower than that established for such rate in the previous tranche (or, in the case of the first tranche, than that established for such rate under subsection (c)(3)); and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>may establish different bonus allowance levels for no more than 5 different project categories, defined by coal type, capture technology, geological formation type, new unit versus retrofit application, such other factors as the Administrator may prescribe, or any combination thereof.</text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Criteria for establishing bonus allowance values</header><text>In setting bonus allowance values under this paragraph, the Administrator shall seek to cover no more than the reasonable incremental capital and operating costs of a project that are attributable to implementation of carbon capture, transportation, and sequestration technologies, taking into account—</text> 
<clause><text>the reduced cost of compliance with section 722 of this Act;</text></clause> 
<clause><text>the reduced cost associated with sequestering in a geological formation for purposes of enhanced hydrocarbon recovery when compared to sequestration into geological formations solely for purposes of sequestration;</text></clause> 
<clause><text>the relevant factors defining the project category; and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>such other factors as the Administrator determines are appropriate.</text></clause></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Revision of regulations</header><text>The Administrator shall review, and as appropriate revise, the applicable regulations under this subsection no less frequently than every 8 years.</text></paragraph></subsection>

<section><header>Open fuel standard</header> 
<subsection><header>Findings</header><text>The Congress finds that—</text> 
<paragraph><text>the status of oil as a strategic commodity, which derives from its domination of the transportation sector, presents a clear and present danger to the United States;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>in a prior era, when salt was a strategic commodity, salt mines conferred national power and wars were fought over the control of such mines;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>technology, in the form of electricity and refrigeration, decisively ended salt’s monopoly of meat preservation and greatly reduced its strategic importance;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>fuel competition and consumer choice would similarly serve to end oil’s monopoly in the transportation sector and strip oil of its strategic status;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>the current closed fuel market has allowed a cartel of petroleum exporting countries to inflate fuel prices, effectively imposing a harmful tax on the economy of the United States;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>much of the inflated petroleum revenues the oil cartel earns at the expense of the people of the United States are used for purposes antithetical to the interests of the United States and its allies;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>alcohol fuels, including ethanol and methanol, could potentially provide significant supplies of additional fuels that could be produced in the United States and in many other countries in the Western Hemisphere that are friendly to the United States;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>alcohol fuels can only play a major role in securing the energy independence of the United States if a substantial portion of vehicles in the United States are capable of operating on such fuels;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>it is not in the best interest of United States consumers or the United States Government to be constrained to depend solely upon petroleum resources for vehicle fuels if alcohol fuels are potentially available;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>existing technology, in the form of flexible fuel vehicles, allows internal combustion engine cars and trucks to be produced at little or no additional cost, which are capable of operating on conventional gasoline, alcohol fuels, or any combination of such fuels, as availability or cost advantage dictates, providing a platform on which fuels can compete;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>the necessary distribution system for such alcohol fuels will not be developed in the United States until a substantial fraction of the vehicles in the United States are capable of operating on such fuels;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>the establishment of such a vehicle fleet and distribution system would provide a large market that would mobilize private resources to substantially advance the technology and expand the production of alcohol fuels in the United States and abroad;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>the United States has an urgent national security interest to develop alcohol fuels technology, production, and distribution systems as rapidly as possible;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>new cars sold in the United States that are equipped with an internal combustion engine should allow for fuel competition by being flexible fuel vehicles, and new diesel cars should be capable of operating on biodiesel; and</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>such an open fuel standard would help to protect the United States economy from high and volatile oil prices and from the threats caused by global instability, terrorism, and natural disaster.</text></paragraph></subsection>

<quoted-block> 
<section><header>Transmission planning</header> 
<subsection><header>Federal policy for transmission planning</header> 
<paragraph><header>Objectives</header><text>It is the policy of the United States that regional electric grid planning should facilitate the deployment of renewable and other zero-carbon and low-carbon energy sources for generating electricity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring reliability, reducing congestion, ensuring cyber-security, minimizing environmental harm, and providing for cost-effective electricity services throughout the United States, in addition to serving the objectives stated in section 217(b)(4).</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Options</header><text>In addition to the policy under paragraph (1), it is the policy of the United States that regional electric grid planning to meet these objectives should result from an open, inclusive and transparent process, taking into account all significant demand-side and supply-side options, including energy efficiency, distributed generation, renewable energy and zero-carbon electricity generation technologies, smart-grid technologies and practices, demand response, electricity storage, voltage regulation technologies, high capacity conductors with at least 25 percent greater efficiency than traditional ACSR (aluminum stranded conductors steel reinforced) conductors, superconductor technologies, underground transmission technologies, and new conventional electric transmission capacity and corridors.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Planning</header><text/> 
<paragraph><header>Planning principles</header><text>Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, the Commission shall adopt, after notice and opportunity for comment, national electricity grid planning principles derived from the Federal policy established under subsection (a) to be applied in ongoing and future transmission planning that may implicate interstate transmission of electricity.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Regional planning entities</header><text>Not later than 3 months after the date of adoption by the Commission of national electricity grid planning principles pursuant to paragraph (1), entities that conduct or may conduct transmission planning pursuant to State, tribal, or Federal law or regulation, including States, Indian tribes, entities designated by States and Indian tribes, Federal Power Marketing Administrations, transmission providers, operators and owners, regional organizations, and electric utilities, and that are willing to incorporate the national electricity grid planning principles adopted by the Commission in their electric grid planning, shall identify themselves and the regions for which they propose to develop plans to the Commission.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Coordination of regional planning entities</header><text>The Commission shall encourage regional planning entities described under paragraph (2) to cooperate and coordinate across regions and to harmonize regional electric grid planning with planning in adjacent or overlapping jurisdictions to the maximum extent feasible. The Commission shall work with States, Indian tribes, Federal land management agencies, State energy, environment, natural resources, and land management agencies and commissions, Federal power marketing administrations, electric utilities, transmission providers, load-serving entities, transmission operators, regional transmission organizations, independent system operators, and other organizations to resolve any conflict or competition among proposed planning entities in order to build consensus and promote the Federal policy established under subsection (a). The Commission shall seek to ensure that planning that is consistent with the national electricity grid planning principles adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) is conducted in all regions of the United States and the territories, but in a manner that, to the extent feasible, avoids uncoordinated planning by more than one planning entity for the same area.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Relation to existing planning policy</header><text>In implementing the Federal policy established under subsection (a), the Commission shall—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>incorporate and coordinate with any ongoing planning efforts undertaken pursuant to section 217 and Commission Order No. 890;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>coordinate with the Secretary of Energy in providing to the regional planning entities an annual summary of national energy policy priorities and goals; </text></subparagraph>

<paragraph><header>Assistance</header><text/> 
<subparagraph><header>In general</header><text>The Commission shall provide support to and may participate if invited to do so in the regional grid planning processes conducted by regional planning entities. The Secretary of Energy and the Commission may provide planning resources and assistance as required or as requested by regional planning entities, including system data, cost information, system analysis, technical expertise, modeling support, dispute resolution services, and other assistance to regional planning entities, as appropriate.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Authorization</header><text>There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this paragraph.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Conflict resolution</header><text>In the event that regional grid plans conflict, the Commission shall assist the regional planning entities in resolving such conflicts in order to achieve the objectives of the Federal policy established under subsection (a).</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Submission of plans</header><text>The Commission shall require regional planning entities to submit initial regional electric grid plans to the Commission not later than 18 months after the date the Commission promulgates national electricity grid planning principles pursuant to paragraph (1), with updates to such plans not less than every 3 years thereafter. The Commission shall review such plans for consistency with the national grid planning principles and may return a plan to one or more planning entities for further consideration, along with the Commission’s own recommendations for resolution of any conflict or for improvement.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Integration of plans</header><text>Regional electric grid plans should, in general, be developed from sub-regional requirements and plans, including planning input reflecting individual utility service areas. Regional plans may then in turn be combined into larger regional plans, up to interconnection-wide and national plans, as appropriate and necessary as determined by the Commission. In no case shall a multi-regional plan impose inclusion of a facility on a region that has submitted a valid plan that, after efforts to resolve the conflict, does not include such facility. To the extent practicable, all plans submitted to the Commission shall be public documents and available on the Commission’s Web site.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Multi-regional meetings</header><text>As regional grid plans are submitted to the Commission, the Commission may convene multi-regional meetings to discuss regional grid plan consistency and integration, including requirements for multi-regional projects, and to resolve any conflicts that emerge from such multi-regional projects. The Commission shall provide its recommendations for eliminating any inter-regional conflicts.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Report to congress</header><text>Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this section and each 3 years thereafter, the Commission shall provide a report to Congress containing the results of the regional grid planning process, including summaries of the adopted regional plans and the extent to which the Federal policy objectives in subsection (a) have been successfully achieved. The Commission shall provide an electronic version of its report on its website with links to all regional and sub-regional plans taken into account.

<section><header>Greater energy efficiency in building codes</header> 
<subsection><header>Energy efficiency targets</header> 
<paragraph><header>In general</header><text>Except as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), the national building code energy efficiency target for the national average percentage improvement of a building’s energy performance when built to a code meeting the target shall be—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>effective on the date of enactment of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, 30 percent reduction in energy use relative to a comparable building constructed in compliance with the baseline code;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>effective January 1, 2014, for residential buildings, and January 1, 2015, for commercial buildings, 50 percent reduction in energy use relative to the baseline code; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>effective January 1, 2017, for residential buildings, and January 1, 2018, for commercial buildings, and every 3 years thereafter, respectively, through January 1, 2029, and January 1, 2030, 5 percent additional reduction in energy use relative to the baseline code.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Consensus-based codes</header><text>If on any effective date specified in paragraph (1)(A), (B), or (C) a successor code to the baseline codes provides for greater reduction in energy use than is required under paragraph (1), the overall percentage reduction in energy use provided by that successor code shall be the national building code energy efficiency target.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Targets established by secretary</header><text>The Secretary may by rule establish a national building code energy efficiency target for residential or commercial buildings achieving greater reductions in energy use than the targets prescribed in paragraph (1) or (2) if the Secretary determines that such greater reductions in energy use can be achieved with a code that is life cycle cost-justified and technically feasible. The Secretary may by rule establish a national building code energy efficiency target for residential or commercial buildings achieving a reduction in energy use that is greater than zero but less than the targets prescribed in paragraph (1) or (2) if the Secretary determines that such lesser target is the maximum reduction in energy use that can be achieved through a code that is life cycle cost-justified and technically feasible.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Additional reductions in energy use</header><text>Effective on January 1, 2033, and once every 3 years thereafter, the Secretary shall determine, after notice and opportunity for comment, whether further energy efficiency building code improvements for residential or commercial buildings, respectively, are life cycle cost-justified and technically feasible, and shall establish updated national building code energy efficiency targets that meet such criteria.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Zero-net-energy buildings</header><text>In setting targets under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider ways to support the deployment of distributed renewable energy technology, and shall seek to achieve the goal of zero-net-energy commercial buildings established in section 422 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ().</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Baseline code</header><text>For purposes of this section, the term <quote>baseline code</quote> means—</text>

<paragraph><header>Requirement</header> 
<subparagraph><header>In general</header><text>There shall be established national energy efficiency building codes under this subsection, for residential and commercial buildings, sufficient to meet each of the national building code energy efficiency targets established under subsection (a), not later than the date that is 1 year after the deadline for establishment of each such target, except that the national energy efficiency building code established to meet the target described in subsection (a)(1)(A) shall be established by not later than 15 months after the effective date of that target.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Existing code</header><text>If the Secretary finds prior to the date provided in subparagraph (A) for establishing a national code for any target that one or more energy efficiency building codes published by a recognized developer of national energy codes and standards meet or exceed the established target, the Secretary shall select the code that meets the target with the highest efficiency in the most cost-effective manner, and such code shall be the national energy efficiency building code.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Requirement to establish code</header><text>If the Secretary does not make a finding under subparagraph (B), the national energy efficiency building code shall be established by rule by the Secretary under paragraph (2).</text></subparagraph></paragraph>

In a State where local governments provide substantially all building code enforcement, a minimum of 50 percent of the allowance value received pursuant to this section shall be distributed to local governments as a function of the relative populations of such localities. In a State where local and State governments share building code enforcement duties, the State and local shares of allowance value required for enforcement shall be allocated in proportion to the number of building inspections performed by each level of government, and the share for local governments shall be distributed as a function of the relative populations of such localities. States shall further ensure that the allowance value made available pursuant to section 782 of the Clean Air Act and section 132 of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 is provided to the applicable State or local governmental entities as necessary to adopt and implement energy efficiency building codes, provide training for inspectors, ensure compliance, and provide such other functions as necessary. Actions taken by local authorities pursuant to this section shall constitute an acceptable use of funds authorized pursuant to the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program under section 544 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ().</text></paragraph></subsection>

<paragraph><header>State energy program</header><text>The term <quote>State Energy Program</quote> means the program under part D of title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act ().</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Establishment</header><text>The Administrator shall develop and implement, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, standards for a national energy and environmental building retrofit policy for single-family and multifamily residences. The Administrator shall develop and implement, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the Director of Commercial High-Performance Green Buildings, standards for a national energy and environmental building retrofit policy for nonresidential buildings. The programs to implement the residential and nonresidential policies based on the standards developed under this section shall together be known as the Retrofit for Energy and Environmental Performance (REEP) program.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Purpose</header><text>The purpose of the REEP program is to facilitate the retrofitting of existing buildings across the United States to achieve maximum cost-effective energy efficiency improvements and significant improvements in water use and other environmental attributes.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Federal administration</header> 
<paragraph><header>Existing programs</header><text>In creating and operating the REEP program—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>the Administrator shall make appropriate use of existing programs, including the Energy Star program and in particular the Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star for Buildings program; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>the Secretary of Energy shall make appropriate use of existing programs, including delegating authority to the Director of Commercial High-Performance Green Buildings appointed under section 421 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (), who shall designate and provide funding to support a high-performance green building partnership consortium pursuant to subsection (f) of such section to support efforts under this section.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Consultation and coordination</header><text>The Administrator and the Secretary of Energy shall consult with and coordinate with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in carrying out the REEP program with regard to retrofitting of public housing and assisted housing. As a result of such consultation, the Administrator shall establish standards to ensure that retrofits of public housing and assisted housing funded pursuant to this section are cost-effective, including opportunities to address the potential co-performance of repair and replacement needs that may be supported with other forms of Federal assistance. Owners of public housing or assisted housing receiving funding through the REEP program shall agree to continue to provide affordable housing consistent with the provisions of the authorizing legislation governing each program for an additional period commensurate with the funding received, as determined in accordance with guidelines established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Assistance</header><text>The Administrator and the Secretary of Energy shall provide consultation and assistance to State and local agencies for the establishment of revolving loan funds, loan guarantees, or other forms of financial assistance under this section.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>State and local administration</header> 
<paragraph><header>Designation and delegation</header><text>A State may designate one or more agencies or entities, including those regulated by the State, to carry out the purposes of this section, but shall designate one entity or individual as the principal point of contact for the Administrator regarding the REEP Program. The designated State agency, agencies, or entities may delegate performance of appropriate elements of the REEP program, upon their request and subject to State law, to counties, municipalities, appropriate public agencies, and other divisions of local government, as well as to entities regulated by the State. In making any such designation or delegation, a State shall give priority to entities that administer existing comprehensive retrofit programs, including those under the supervision of State utility regulators. States shall maintain responsibility for meeting the standards and requirements of the REEP program. In any State that elects not to administer the REEP program, a unit of local government may propose to do so within its jurisdiction, and if the Administrator finds that such local government is capable of administering the program, the Administrator may provide allowances to that local government, prorated according to the population of the local jurisdiction relative to the population of the State, for purposes of the REEP program.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Employment</header><text>States and local government entities may administer a REEP program in a manner that authorizes public or regulated investor-owned utilities, building auditors and inspectors, contractors, nonprofit organizations, for-profit companies, and other entities to perform audits and retrofit services under this section. A State may provide incentives for retrofits without direct participation by the State or its agents, so long as the resulting savings are measured and verified. A State or local administrator of a REEP program shall seek to ensure that sufficient qualified entities are available to support retrofit activities so that building owners have a competitive choice among qualified auditors, raters, contractors, and providers of services related to retrofits. Nothing in this section is intended to deny the right of a building owner to choose the specific providers of retrofit services to engage for a retrofit project in that owner’s building.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Equal incentives for equal improvement</header><text>In general, the States should strive to offer the same levels of incentives for retrofits that meet the same efficiency improvement goals, regardless of whether the State, its agency or entity, or the building owner has conducted the retrofit achieving the improvement, provided the improvement is measured and verified.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Elements of reep program</header><text>The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall establish goals, guidelines, practices, and standards for accomplishing the purpose stated in subsection (c), and shall annually review and, as appropriate, revise such goals, guidelines, practices, and standards. The program under this section shall include the following:</text> 
<paragraph><text>Residential Energy Services Network (RESNET) or Building Performance Institute (BPI) analyst certification of residential building energy and environment auditors, inspectors, and raters, or an equivalent certification system as determined by the Administrator.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>BPI certification or licensing by States of residential building energy and environmental retrofit contractors, or an equivalent certification or licensing system as determined by the Administrator.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Provision of BPI, RESNET, or other appropriate information on equipment and procedures, as determined by the Administrator, that contractors can use to test the energy and environmental efficiency of buildings effectively (such as infrared photography and pressurized testing, and tests for water use and indoor air quality).</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Provision of clear and effective materials to describe the testing and retrofit processes for typical buildings.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Guidelines for offering and managing prescriptive building retrofit programs and performance-based building retrofit programs for residential and nonresidential buildings.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Guidelines for applying recommissioning and retrocommissioning principles to improve a building’s operations and maintenance procedures.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>A requirement that building retrofits conducted pursuant to a REEP program utilize, especially in all air-conditioned buildings, roofing materials with high solar energy reflectance, unless inappropriate due to green roof management, solar energy production, or for other reasons identified by the Administrator, in order to reduce energy consumption within the building, increase the albedo of the building’s roof, and decrease the heat island effect in the area of the building, without reduction of otherwise applicable ceiling insulation standards.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Determination of energy savings in a performance-based building retrofit program through—</text>

<paragraph><text>Global warming poses a significant threat to the national security, economy, public health and welfare, and environment of the United States, as well as of other nations.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Reviews of scientific studies, including by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrate that global warming is the result of the combined anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from numerous sources of all types and sizes. Each increment of emission, when combined with other emissions, causes or contributes materially to the acceleration and extent of global warming and its adverse effects for the lifetime of such gas in the atmosphere. Accordingly, controlling emissions in small as well as large amounts is essential to prevent, slow the pace of, reduce the threats from, and mitigate global warming and its adverse effects.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Because they induce global warming, greenhouse gas emissions cause or contribute to injuries to persons in the United States, including—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>adverse health effects such as disease and loss of life;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>displacement of human populations;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>damage to property and other interests related to ocean levels, acidification, and ice changes;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>severe weather and seasonal changes;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>disruption, costs, and losses to business, trade, employment, farms, subsistence, aesthetic enjoyment of the environment, recreation, culture, and tourism;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>damage to plants, forests, lands, and waters;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>harm to wildlife and habitat;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>scarcity of water and the decreased abundance of other natural resources;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>worsening of tropospheric air pollution;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>substantial threats of similar damage; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>other harm.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>That many of these effects and risks of future effects of global warming are widely shared does not minimize the adverse effects individual persons have suffered, will suffer, and are at risk of suffering because of global warming.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>That some of the adverse and potentially catastrophic effects of global warming are at risk of occurring and not a certainty does not negate the harm persons suffer from actions that increase the likelihood, extent, and severity of such future impacts.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Nations of the world look to the United States for leadership in addressing the threat of and harm from global warming. Full implementation of the Safe Climate Act is critical to engage other nations in an international effort to mitigate the threat of and harm from global warming.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Global warming and its adverse effects are occurring and are likely to continue and increase in magnitude, and to do so at a greater and more harmful rate, unless the Safe Climate Act is fully implemented and enforced in an expeditious manner.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Purpose</header><text>It is the general purpose of the Safe Climate Act to help prevent, reduce the pace of, mitigate, and remedy global warming and its adverse effects. To fulfill such purpose, it is necessary to—</text> 
<paragraph><text>require the timely fulfillment of all governmental acts and duties, both substantive and procedural, and the prompt compliance of covered entities with the requirements of the Safe Climate Act;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>establish and maintain an effective, transparent, and fair market for emission allowances and preserve the integrity of the cap on emissions and of offset credits;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>advance the production and deployment of clean energy and energy efficiency technologies; and</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>ensure effective enforcement of the Safe Climate Act by citizens, States, Indian tribes, and all levels of government because each violation of the Safe Climate Act is likely to result in an additional increment of greenhouse gas emission and will slow the pace of implementation of the Safe Climate Act and delay the achievement of the goals set forth in section 702, and cause or contribute to global warming and its adverse effects.</text></paragraph></subsection></section> 
<section><header>Economy-wide reduction goals</header><text>The goals of the Safe Climate Act are to reduce steadily the quantity of United States greenhouse gas emissions such that—</text> 
<paragraph><text>in 2012, the quantity of United States greenhouse gas emissions does not exceed 97 percent of the quantity of United States greenhouse gas emissions in 2005;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>in 2020, the quantity of United States greenhouse gas emissions does not exceed 80 percent of the quantity of United States greenhouse gas emissions in 2005;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>in 2030, the quantity of United States greenhouse gas emissions does not exceed 58 percent of the quantity of United States greenhouse gas emissions in 2005; and</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>in 2050, the quantity of United States greenhouse gas emissions does not exceed 17 percent of the quantity of United States greenhouse gas emissions in 2005.</text></paragraph></section> 
<section><header>Reduction targets for specified sources</header> 
<subsection><header>In general</header><text>The regulations issued under section 721 shall cap and reduce annually the greenhouse gas emissions of capped sources each calendar year beginning in 2012 such that—</text> 
<paragraph><text>in 2012, the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions from capped sources does not exceed 97 percent of the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions from such sources in 2005;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>in 2020, the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions from capped sources does not exceed 83 percent of the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions from such sources in 2005;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>in 2030, the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions from capped sources does not exceed 58 percent of the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions from such sources in 2005; and</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>in 2050, the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions from capped sources does not exceed 17 percent of the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions from such sources in 2005.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Definition</header><text>For purposes of this section, the term <quote>greenhouse gas emissions from such sources in 2005</quote> means emissions to which section 722 would have applied if the requirements of this title for the specified year had been in effect for 2005. </text></subsection></section> 
<section><header>Supplemental pollution reductions</header><text>For the purposes of decreasing the likelihood of catastrophic climate change, preserving tropical forests, building capacity to generate offset credits, and facilitating international action on global warming, the Administrator shall set aside the percentage specified in section 781 of the quantity of emission allowances established under section 721(a) for each year, to be used to achieve a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation in developing countries in accordance with part E. In 2020, activities supported under part E shall provide greenhouse gas reductions in an amount equal to an additional 10 percentage points of reductions from United States greenhouse gas emissions in 2005. The Administrator shall distribute these allowances with respect to activities in countries that enter into and implement agreements or arrangements relating to reduced deforestation as described in section 754(a)(2).</text></section>

<paragraph><header>Establishment and distribution</header> 
<subparagraph><header>In general</header><text>Not later than 90 days after the end of each calendar year, the Administrator shall establish and distribute to the entity taking the actions described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) a quantity of compensatory allowances equivalent to the number of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of avoided emissions achieved through such actions. In establishing the quantity of compensatory allowances, the Administrator shall take into account the carbon dioxide equivalent value of any greenhouse gas resulting from such action.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Source of allowances</header><text>Compensatory allowances established under this subsection shall not be emission allowances established under subsection (a).</text></subparagraph>

<paragraph><header>Definitions</header><text>For purposes of this subsection—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>the term <quote>destruction</quote> means the conversion of a greenhouse gas by thermal, chemical, or other means to another gas or set of gases with little or no carbon dioxide equivalent value;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>the term <quote>nonemissive use</quote> means the use of fossil fuel as a feedstock in an industrial or manufacturing process to the extent that greenhouse gases are not emitted from such process, and to the extent that the products of such process are not intended for use as, or to be contained in, a fuel; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>the term <quote>conversionary use</quote> means the conversion during research or manufacturing of a fluorinated gas into another greenhouse gas or set of gases with a lower carbon dioxide equivalent value.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Feedstock emissions study</header> 
<subparagraph><text>The Administrator may conduct a study to determine the extent to which petroleum-based or coal-based liquid or gaseous fuel, petroleum coke, natural gas liquid, or natural gas are used as feedstocks in manufacturing processes to produce products and the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from such uses.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>If as a result of such a study, the Administrator determines that the use of such products by noncovered sources results in substantial emissions of greenhouse gases and that such emissions have not been adequately addressed under other requirements of this Act, the Administrator may, after notice and comment rulemaking, promulgate a regulation reducing compensatory allowances commensurately if doing so will not result in shifting such emissions to noncovered sources. </text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection>

<paragraph><header>Algae-based fuels</header><text>Where carbon dioxide (or another greenhouse gas) generated by a covered entity is used as an input in the production of algae-based fuels, the Administrator shall ensure that emission allowances are required to be held either for the carbon dioxide generated by a covered entity that is used to grow the algae or for the portion of the carbon dioxide emitted from combustion of the fuel produced from such algae that is attributable to carbon dioxide generated by a covered entity, but not for both. </text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Fugitive emissions</header><text>The greenhouse gas emissions to which paragraphs (1), (4), (6), and (7) apply shall not include fugitive emissions of greenhouse gas, except to the extent the Administrator determines that data on the carbon dioxide equivalent value of greenhouse gas in the fugitive emissions can be provided with sufficient precision, reliability, accessibility, and timeliness to ensure the integrity of emission allowances, the allowance tracking system, and the cap on emissions.</text></paragraph>

<subsection><header>Phase-in of prohibition</header> 
<paragraph><header>Industrial stationary sources</header><text>The prohibition under subsection (a) shall first apply to a covered entity described in section 700(13)(D), (F), (G), (H), or (I), with respect to emissions occurring during calendar year 2014.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Natural gas local distribution companies</header><text>The prohibition under subsection (a) shall first apply to a covered entity described in section 700(13)(J) with respect to deliveries occurring during calendar year 2016.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Additional methods</header><text>In addition to using the method of compliance described in subsection (b), a covered entity may do the following:</text> 
<paragraph><header>Offset credits</header> 
<subparagraph><header>In general</header><text>Covered entities collectively may, in accordance with this paragraph, use offset credits to demonstrate compliance for up to a maximum of 2 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually. The ability to demonstrate compliance with offset credits shall be divided pro rata among covered entities by allowing each covered entity to satisfy a percentage of the number of allowances required to be held under subsection (b) to demonstrate compliance by holding 1 domestic offset credit or 1.25 international offset credits in lieu of an emission allowance, except as provided in subparagraph (D).</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Applicable percentage</header><text>The percentage referred to in subparagraph (A) for a given calendar year shall be determined by dividing 2 billion by the sum of 2 billion plus the number of emission allowances established under section 721(a) for the previous year, and multiplying that number by 100. Not more than one half of the applicable percentage under this paragraph may be used by holding domestic offset credits, and not more than one half of the applicable percentage under this paragraph may be used by holding international offset credits, except as provided in subparagraph (C).</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Modified percentages</header><text>If the Administrator determines that domestic offset credits available for use in demonstrating compliance in any calendar year at domestic offset prices generally equal to or less than emission allowance prices, are likely to offset less than 0.9 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions (measured in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents), for purposes of compliance demonstration in that year the Administrator shall—</text> 
<clause><text>increase the percentage of emissions that can be offset through the use of international offset credits to reflect the amount that 1.0 billion exceeds the number of domestic offset credits the Administrator determines is available, at prices generally equal to or less than emission allowance prices, for that year, up to a maximum of 0.5 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions; and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>decrease the percentage of emissions that can be offset through the use of domestic offset credits by the same amount.</text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>International offset credits</header><text>Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), to demonstrate compliance prior to calendar year 2018, a covered entity may use 1 international offset credit in lieu of an emission allowance up to the amount permitted under this paragraph.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>President’s recommendation</header><text>The President may make a recommendation to Congress as to whether the number 2 billion specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) should be increased or decreased.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Term offset credits</header> 
<subparagraph><header>In general</header><text>Covered entities may, in accordance with this paragraph, use non-expired term offset credits instead of domestic offset credits for purposes of temporarily demonstrating compliance with this section.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Amount</header><text>The combined quantity of term offset credits and domestic offset credits used by a covered entity to demonstrate compliance for its emissions or attributable greenhouse gas emissions in any given year shall not exceed the quantity of domestic offset credits that a covered entity is entitled to use for that year to demonstrate compliance in accordance with paragraph (1).</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Expiration</header><text>A term offset credit shall expire in the year after its term ends. The term of a term offset credit shall be calculated by adding to the year of issuance the number of years equal to the length of the crediting period for the practice or project for which the term offset credit was issued, but in no case shall be later than the date 5 years from the date of issuance.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Demonstrating compliance upon expiration of term offset credit</header><text>With respect to the emissions for which a covered entity is using term offset credits to demonstrate compliance temporarily with this section, the owner or operator of a covered entity shall not be considered to be in compliance with the prohibition in subsection (a) unless, as of 12:01 a.m. on April 1 (or a later date established by the Administrator under subsection (j)) of the calendar year in which a term offset credit expires, the owner or operator holds—</text> 
<clause><text>for purposes of finally demonstrating compliance, an allowance or a domestic offset credit; or</text></clause> 
<clause><text>for purposes of temporarily demonstrating compliance, a non-expired term offset credit.</text></clause><continuation-text>Domestic offset credits used for purposes of finally demonstrating compliance under this subparagraph shall not be subject to the percentage limitations in subparagraph (B).</continuation-text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Financial assurance</header><text>A covered entity may not use a term offset credit to demonstrate compliance temporarily unless it simultaneously provides to the Administrator financial assurance that, at the end of the term offset credit’s crediting term, the covered entity will have sufficient resources to obtain the quantity of allowances or credits necessary to demonstrate final compliance. The Administrator shall issue regulations establishing requirements for such financial assurance, which shall take into account the increased risk associated with longer crediting terms. These regulations shall take into account the total number of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gas emissions for which a covered entity is demonstrating compliance temporarily, and may set a limit on this amount. In the event that a covered entity that used term offset credits to demonstrate compliance temporarily fails to meet the requirements of subparagraph (D) at the end of the term offset credits’ crediting term, if the financial assurance mechanism fails to provide to the Administrator the number of allowances or offset credits for which the crediting term has expired, then the Administrator shall retire that number of allowances with the vintage year 2 years after the year in which the term offset credit expires in the same amount. Allowances so retired shall not be counted as emission allowances established for that calendar year under section 721(a).</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>International emission allowances</header><text>To demonstrate compliance, a covered entity may hold an international emission allowance in lieu of an emission allowance, except as modified under section 728(d).</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Compensatory allowances</header><text>To demonstrate compliance, a covered entity may hold a compensatory allowance obtained under section 721(f) in lieu of an emission allowance.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Retirement of allowances and credits</header><text>As soon as practicable after a deadline established for covered entities to demonstrate compliance with this title, the Administrator shall retire the quantity of allowances or credits required to be held under this title.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Alternative metrics</header><text>For categories of covered entities described in subparagraph (B), (C), (D), (G), (H), or (I) of section 700(13), the Administrator may, by rule, establish an applicability threshold for inclusion under those subparagraphs using an alternative metric and level, provided that such metric and level are easier to administer and cover the same size and type of sources as the threshold defined in such subparagraphs.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Threshold review</header><text>For each category of covered entities described in subparagraph (B), (C), (D), (G), (H), or (I) of section 700(13), the Administrator shall, in 2020 and once every 8 years thereafter, review the carbon dioxide equivalent emission threshold that is used to define covered entities in such category. After consideration of—</text> 
<paragraph><text>emissions from covered entities in such category, and from other entities of the same type that emit less than the threshold amount for the category (including emission sources that commence operation after the date of enactment of this title that are not covered entities); and</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>whether greater greenhouse gas emission reductions can be cost-effectively achieved by lowering the applicable threshold,</text></paragraph><continuation-text>the Administrator may by rule lower such threshold to not less than 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. In determining the cost effectiveness of potential reductions from lowering the threshold for covered entities, the Administrator shall consider alternative regulatory greenhouse gas programs, including setting standards under other titles of this Act.</continuation-text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Designated representatives</header><text>The regulations promulgated under section 721(h) shall require that each covered entity, and each entity holding allowances or offset credits or receiving allowances or offset credits from the Administrator under this title, submit to the Administrator a certificate of representation designating a designated representative.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Education and outreach</header> 
<paragraph><header>In general</header><text>The Administrator shall establish and carry out a program of education and outreach to assist covered entities, especially entities having little experience with environmental regulatory requirements similar or comparable to those under this title, in preparing to meet the compliance obligations of this title. Such program shall include education with respect to using markets to effectively achieve such compliance.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Failure to receive information</header><text>A failure to receive information or assistance under this subsection may not be used as a defense against an allegation of any violation of this title.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Adjustment of deadline</header><text>The Administrator may, by rule, establish a deadline for demonstrating compliance, for a calendar year, later than the date provided in subsection (a), as necessary to ensure the availability of emissions data, but in no event shall the deadline be later than June 1.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Notice requirement for covered entities receiving natural gas from natural gas local distribution companies</header><text>The owner or operator of a covered entity that takes delivery of natural gas from a natural gas local distribution company shall, not later than September 1 of each calendar year, notify such natural gas local distribution company in writing that such entity will qualify as a covered entity under this title for that calendar year.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Compliance obligation</header><text>For purposes of this title, the year of a compliance obligation is the year in which compliance is determined, not the year in which the greenhouse gas emissions occur or the covered entity has attributable greenhouse gas emissions.</text></subsection></section> 
<section><header>Penalty for noncompliance</header> 
<subsection><header>Enforcement</header><text>A violation of any prohibition of, requirement of, or regulation promulgated pursuant to this title shall be a violation of this Act. It shall be a violation of this Act for a covered entity to emit greenhouse gases and have attributable greenhouse gas emissions, in combination, in excess of its allowable emissions level as provided in section 722(a). Each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent for which a covered entity fails to demonstrate compliance under section 722 shall be a separate violation. In the event that a covered entity fails to demonstrate compliance at the expiration of a term offset credit’s crediting term as required by section 722(d)(2)(D), the year of the violation shall be the year in which the term offset credit expires.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Excess emissions penalty</header> 
<paragraph><header>In general</header><text>The owner or operator of any covered entity that fails for any year to comply, on the deadline described in section 722(a), (d)(2), or (j), shall be liable for payment to the Administrator of an excess emissions penalty in the amount described in paragraph (2).</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Amount</header><text>The amount of an excess emissions penalty required to be paid under paragraph (1) shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>the tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gas emissions or attributable greenhouse gas emissions for which the owner or operator of a covered entity failed to demonstrate compliance under section 722 on the deadline; by</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>twice the auction clearing price for the earliest vintage year emission allowances in the last auction carried out pursuant to section 791 before such deadline.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Timing</header><text>An excess emissions penalty required under this subsection shall be immediately due and payable to the Administrator, without demand, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Administrator, which shall be issued not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this title.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>No effect on liability</header><text>An excess emissions penalty due and payable by the owners or operators of a covered entity under this subsection shall not diminish the liability of the owners or operators for any fine, penalty, or assessment against the owners or operators for the same violation under any other provision of this Act or any other law.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Excess emissions allowances</header><text>The owner or operator of a covered entity that fails for any year to comply on the deadline described in section 722(a), (d)(2), or (j) shall be liable to offset the covered entity’s excess combination of greenhouse gases emitted and attributable greenhouse gas emissions by an equal quantity of emission allowances during the following calendar year, or such longer period as the Administrator may prescribe. During the year in which the covered entity failed to comply, or any year thereafter, the Administrator may deduct the emission allowances required under this subsection to offset the covered entity’s excess greenhouse gas emissions or attributable greenhouse gas emissions.</text></subsection></section> 
<section><header>Trading</header> 
<subsection><header>Permitted transactions</header><text>Except as otherwise provided in this title, the lawful holder of an emission allowance, compensatory allowance, or offset credit may, without restriction, sell, exchange, transfer, hold for compliance in accordance with section 722, or request that the Administrator retire the emission allowance, compensatory allowance, or offset credit.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>No restriction on transactions</header><text>The privilege of purchasing, holding, selling, exchanging, transferring, and requesting retirement of emission allowances, compensatory allowances, or offset credits shall not be restricted to the owners and operators of covered entities, except as otherwise provided in this title.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Effectiveness of allowance transfers</header><text>No transfer of an allowance, offset credit, or term offset credit shall be effective for purposes of this title until a certification of the transfer, signed by the designated representative of the transferor, is received and recorded by the Administrator in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 721(h).</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Allowance tracking system</header><text>The regulations promulgated under section 721(h) shall include a system for issuing, recording, holding, and tracking allowances, offset credits, and term offset credits that shall specify all necessary procedures and requirements for an orderly and competitive functioning of the allowance and offset credit markets. Such regulations shall provide for appropriate publication of the information in the system on the Internet.</text></subsection></section>

<subparagraph><text>except as provided in subparagraph (B), assign a vintage year to the emission allowance, which shall be no earlier than the year in which the allowance is established under paragraph (2), and shall treat such allowances as ones that are not designated for distribution or auction for purposes of section 782(q) and (r); and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>to the extent any such allowances cannot be assigned a vintage year because of the limitation in paragraph (4), retire the allowances.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Limitation</header><text>In no case may the Administrator assign under paragraph (3)(A) more emission allowances to a vintage year than the number of emission allowances from that vintage year that were placed in the strategic reserve account under subsection (b)(1). </text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Availability of international offset credits for auction</header><text/> 
<paragraph><header>In general</header><text>The regulations promulgated under section 721(h) shall allow any entity holding international offset credits from reduced deforestation issued under section 743(e) to request that the Administrator include such offset credits in an upcoming strategic reserve auction. The regulations shall provide that—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>such international offset credits will be used to fill bid orders only after the supply of strategic reserve allowances available for sale at that auction has been depleted;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>international offset credits may be sold at a strategic reserve auction under this subsection only if the Administrator determines that it is highly likely that covered entities will, to cover emissions occurring in the year the auction is held, use offset credits to demonstrate compliance under section 722 for emissions equal to or greater than 80 percent of 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>upon sale of such international offset credits, the Administrator shall retire those international offset credits, and establish and provide to the purchasers a number of emission allowances equal to 80 percent of the number of international offset credits so retired, which allowances shall be in addition to those established under section 721(a); and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>for international offset credits sold pursuant to this subsection, the proceeds for the entity that offered the international offset credits for sale shall be the lesser of—</text> 
<clause><text>the average daily closing price for international offset credits sold on registered exchanges (or if such price is unavailable, the average price as determined by the Administrator) during the six months prior to the strategic reserve auction at which they were auctioned, with the remaining funds collected upon the sale of the international offset credits deposited in the Treasury; and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>the amount received for the international offset credits at the auction.</text></clause></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Proceeds</header><text>For international offset credits sold pursuant to this subsection, notwithstanding  of title 31, United States Code, or any other provision of law, within 90 days of receipt, the United States shall transfer the proceeds from the auction, as defined in paragraph (1)(D), to the entity that offered the international offset credits for sale. No funds transferred from a purchaser to a seller of international offset credits under this paragraph shall be held by any officer or employee of the United States or treated for any purpose as public monies.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Pricing</header><text>When the Administrator acts under this subsection as the agent of an entity in possession of international offset credits, the Administrator is not obligated to obtain the highest price possible for the international offset credits, and instead shall auction such international offset credits in the same manner and pursuant to the same rules (except as modified in paragraph (1)) as set forth for auctioning strategic reserve allowances. Entities requesting that such international offset credits be offered for sale at a strategic reserve auction may not set a minimum reserve price for their international offset credits that is different than the minimum strategic reserve auction price set pursuant to subsection (c).</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Initial regulations</header><text>Not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of this title, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations, in consultation with other appropriate agencies, governing the auction of allowances under this section. Such regulations shall include the following requirements:</text> 
<paragraph><header>Frequency; first auction</header><text>Auctions shall be held four times per year at regular intervals, with the first auction to be held no later than March 31, 2012.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Auction format</header><text>Auctions shall follow a single-round, sealed-bid, uniform price format.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Participation; financial assurance</header><text>Auctions shall be open to any covered entity eligible to purchase emission allowances at the auction under subsection (a)(2), except that the Administrator may establish financial assurance requirements to ensure that auction participants can and will perform on their bids.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Disclosure of beneficial ownership</header><text>Each bidder in an auction shall be required to disclose the person or entity sponsoring or benefitting from the bidder’s participation in the auction if such person or entity is, in whole or in part, other than the bidder.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Purchase limits</header><text>No person may, directly or in concert with another participant, purchase more than 20 percent of the allowances offered for sale at any quarterly auction.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Publication of information</header><text>After the auction, the Administrator shall, in a timely fashion, publish the identities of winning bidders, the quantity of allowances obtained by each winning bidder, and the auction clearing price.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Other requirements</header><text>The Administrator may include in the regulations such other requirements or provisions as the Administrator, in consultation with other agencies as appropriate, considers appropriate to promote effective, efficient, transparent, and fair administration of auctions under this section.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Revision of regulations</header><text>The Administrator may, at any time, in consultation with other agencies as appropriate, revise the initial regulations promulgated under subsection (i) by promulgating new regulations. Such revised regulations need not meet the requirements identified in subsection (i) if the Administrator determines that an alternative auction design would be more effective, taking into account factors including costs of administration, transparency, fairness, and risks of collusion or manipulation. In determining whether and how to revise the initial regulations under this subsection, the Administrator shall not consider maximization of revenues to the Federal Government.</text></subsection></section> 
<section><header>Permits</header> 
<subsection><header>Permit program</header><text>For stationary sources subject to title V of this Act that are covered entities, the provisions of this title shall be implemented by permits issued to such covered entities (and enforced) in accordance with the provisions of title V, as modified by this title. Any such permit issued by the Administrator, or by a State or Indian tribe with an approved permit program, shall require the owner or operator of a covered entity to hold allowances or offset credits at least equal to the total annual amount of carbon dioxide equivalents for its combined emissions and attributable greenhouse gas emissions to which section 722 applies. No such permit shall be issued that is inconsistent with the requirements of this title, and title V as applicable. Nothing in this section regarding compliance plans or in title V shall be construed as affecting allowances or offset credits. Submission of a statement by the owner or operator, or the designated representative of the owners and operators, of a covered entity that the owners and operators will hold allowances or offset credits for the entity’s combined emissions and attributable greenhouse gas emissions to which section 722 applies shall be deemed to meet the proposed and approved planning requirements of title V. Recordation by the Administrator of transfers of allowances and offset credits shall amend automatically all applicable proposed or approved permit applications, compliance plans, and permits.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Multiple owners</header><text>No permit shall be issued under this section and no allowances or offset credits shall be disbursed under this title to a covered entity or any other person until the designated representative of the owners or operators has filed a certificate of representation with regard to matters under this title, including the holding and distribution of emission allowances and the proceeds of transactions involving emission allowances. Where there are multiple holders of a legal or equitable title to, or a leasehold interest in, such a covered entity or other entity or where a utility or industrial customer purchases power under a long-term power purchase contract from an independent power production facility that is a covered entity, the certificate shall state—</text> 
<paragraph><text>that emission allowances and the proceeds of transactions involving emission allowances will be deemed to be held or distributed in proportion to each holder’s legal, equitable, leasehold, or contractual reservation or entitlement; or</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>if such multiple holders have expressly provided for a different distribution of emission allowances by contract, that emission allowances and the proceeds of transactions involving emission allowances will be deemed to be held or distributed in accordance with the contract.</text></paragraph><continuation-text>A passive lessor, or a person who has an equitable interest through such lessor, whose rental payments are not based, either directly or indirectly, upon the revenues or income from the covered entity or other entity shall not be deemed to be a holder of a legal, equitable, leasehold, or contractual interest for the purpose of holding or distributing emission allowances as provided in this subsection, during either the term of such leasehold or thereafter, unless expressly provided for in the leasehold agreement. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, where all legal or equitable title to or interest in a covered entity, or other entity, is held by a single person, the certificate shall state that all emission allowances received by the entity are deemed to be held for that person.</continuation-text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Prohibition</header><text>It shall be unlawful for any person to operate any stationary source subject to the requirements of this section except in compliance with the terms and requirements of a permit issued by the Administrator or a State or Indian tribe with an approved permit program in accordance with this section. For purposes of this subsection, compliance, as provided in section 504(f), with a permit issued under title V which complies with this title for covered entities shall be deemed compliance with this subsection as well as section 502(a).</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Reliability</header><text>Nothing in this section or title V shall be construed as requiring termination of operations of a stationary source that is a covered entity for failure to have an approved permit, or compliance plan, that is consistent with the requirements in the second and fifth sentences of subsection (a) concerning the holding of allowances or offset credits, except that any such covered entity may be subject to the applicable enforcement provision of section 113.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Regulations</header><text>Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this title, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations to implement this section. To provide for permits required under this section, each State in which one or more stationary sources that are covered entities are located shall submit, in accordance with this section and title V, revised permit programs for approval.</text></subsection></section> 
<section><header>International emission allowances</header> 
<subsection><header>Qualifying programs</header><text>The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may by rule designate an international climate change program as a qualifying international program if—</text> 
<paragraph><text>the program is run by a national or supranational foreign government, and imposes a mandatory absolute tonnage limit on greenhouse gas emissions from 1 or more foreign countries, or from 1 or more economic sectors in such a country or countries; and</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>the program is at least as stringent as the program established by this title, including provisions to ensure at least comparable monitoring, compliance, enforcement, quality of offsets, and restrictions on the use of offsets.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Disqualified allowances</header><text>An international emission allowance may not be held under section 722(d)(2) if it is in the nature of an offset instrument or allowance awarded based on the achievement of greenhouse gas emission reductions or avoidance, or greenhouse gas sequestration, that are not subject to the mandatory absolute tonnage limits referred to in subsection (a)(1).</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Retirement</header> 
<paragraph><header>Entity certification</header><text>The owner or operator of an entity that holds an international emission allowance under section 722(d)(2) shall certify to the Administrator that such international emission allowance has not previously been used to comply with any foreign, international, or domestic greenhouse gas regulatory program.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Retirement</header> 
<subparagraph><header>Foreign and international regulatory entities</header><text>The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall seek, by whatever means appropriate, including agreements and technical cooperation on allowance tracking, to ensure that any relevant foreign, international, and domestic regulatory entities—</text> 
<clause><text>are notified of the use, for purposes of compliance with this title, of any international emission allowance; and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>provide for the disqualification of such international emission allowance for any subsequent use under the relevant foreign, international, or domestic greenhouse gas regulatory program, regardless of whether such use is a sale, exchange, or submission to satisfy a compliance obligation.</text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Disqualification from further use</header><text>The Administrator shall ensure that, once an international emission allowance has been disqualified or otherwise used for purposes of compliance with this title, such allowance shall be disqualified from any further use under this title.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Use limitations</header><text>The Administrator may, by rule, apply a limit to the percentage of the combined greenhouse gas emissions and attributable greenhouse gas emissions of a covered entity with respect to which compliance may be demonstrated by holding international emission allowances under section 722(d)(2), consistent with the purposes of the Safe Climate Act.</text></subsection></section></part>

<section><header>Eligible project types</header> 
<subsection><header>List of eligible project types</header> 
<paragraph><header>In general</header><text>As part of the regulations promulgated under section 732(a), the Administrator shall establish, and may periodically revise, a list of types of projects eligible to generate offset credits, including international offset credits, under this part.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Advisory Board recommendations</header><text>In determining the eligibility of project types, the Administrator shall take into consideration the recommendations of the Advisory Board. If a list established under this section differs from the recommendations of the Advisory Board, the regulations promulgated under section 732(a) shall include a justification for the discrepancy.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Initial determination</header><text>The Administrator shall establish the initial eligibility list under paragraph (1) not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this title. The Administrator shall add additional project types to the list not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this title. In determining the initial list, the Administrator shall give priority to consideration of offset project types that are recommended by the Advisory Board and for which there are well developed methodologies that the Administrator determines would meet the criteria of section 734, with such modifications as the Administrator deems appropriate. In establishing methodologies pursuant to section 734, the Administrator shall give priority to methodologies for offset project types included on the initial eligibility list.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Modification of list</header><text>The Administrator—</text> 
<paragraph><text>may at any time, by rule, add a project type to the list established under subsection (a) if the Administrator, in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies and taking into consideration the recommendations of the Advisory Board, determines that the project type can generate additional reductions or avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions, or sequestration of greenhouse gases, subject to the requirements of this part;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>may at any time, by rule, determine that a project type on the list does not meet the requirements of this part, and remove the project type from the list established under subsection (a), in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies and taking into consideration any recommendations of the Advisory Board; and</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>shall consider adding to or removing from the list established under subsection (a), at a minimum, project types proposed to the Administrator—</text>

<subparagraph><text>by the Advisory Board.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Petition process</header><text>Any person may petition the Administrator to modify the list established under subsection (a) by adding or removing a project type pursuant to subsection (b). Any such petition shall include a showing by the petitioner that there is adequate data to establish that the project type does or does not meet the requirements of this part. Not later than 12 months after receipt of such a petition, the Administrator shall either grant or deny the petition and publish a written explanation of the reasons for the Administrator’s decision. The Administrator may not deny a petition under this subsection on the basis of inadequate Environmental Protection Agency resources or time for review.</text></subsection></section> 
<section><header>Requirements for offset projects</header> 
<subsection><header>Methodologies</header><text>As part of the regulations promulgated under section 732(a), the Administrator shall establish, for each type of offset project listed as eligible under section 733, the following:</text> 
<paragraph><header>Additionality</header><text>A standardized methodology for determining the additionality of greenhouse gas emission reductions or avoidance, or greenhouse gas sequestration, achieved by an offset project of that type. Such methodology shall ensure, at a minimum, that any greenhouse gas emission reduction or avoidance, or any greenhouse gas sequestration, is considered additional only to the extent that it results from activities that—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>are not required by or undertaken to comply with any law, including any regulation or consent order;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>were not commenced prior to January 1, 2009, except in the case of—</text> 
<clause><text>offset project activities that commenced after January 1, 2001, and were registered as of the date of enactment of this title under an offset program with respect to which the Administrator has made an affirmative determination under section 740(a)(2); or</text></clause> 
<clause><text>activities that are readily reversible, with respect to which the Administrator may set an alternative earlier date under this subparagraph that is not earlier than January 1, 2001, where the Administrator determines that setting such an alternative date may produce an environmental benefit by removing an incentive to cease and then reinitiate activities that began prior to January 1, 2009; and</text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>exceed the activity baseline established under paragraph (2).</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Activity baselines</header><text>A standardized methodology for establishing activity baselines for offset projects of that type. The Administrator shall set activity baselines to reflect a conservative estimate of business-as-usual performance or practices for the relevant type of activity such that the baseline provides an adequate margin of safety to ensure the environmental integrity of offsets calculated in reference to such baseline.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Quantification methods</header><text>A standardized methodology for determining the extent to which greenhouse gas emission reductions or avoidance, or greenhouse gas sequestration, achieved by an offset project of that type exceed a relevant activity baseline, including protocols for monitoring and accounting for uncertainty.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Leakage</header><text>A standardized methodology for accounting for and mitigating potential leakage, if any, from an offset project of that type, taking uncertainty into account.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Accounting for reversals</header> 
<paragraph><header>In general</header><text>For each type of sequestration project listed under section 733, the Administrator shall establish requirements to account for and address reversals, including—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>a requirement to report any reversal with respect to an offset project for which offset credits have been issued under this part;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>provisions to require emission allowances to be held in amounts to fully compensate for greenhouse gas emissions attributable to reversals, and to assign responsibility for holding such emission allowances; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>any other provisions the Administrator determines necessary to account for and address reversals.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Mechanisms</header><text>The Administrator shall prescribe mechanisms to ensure that any sequestration with respect to which an offset credit is issued under this part results in a permanent net increase in sequestration, and that full account is taken of any actual or potential reversal of such sequestration, with an adequate margin of safety. The Administrator shall prescribe at least one of the following mechanisms to meet the requirements of this paragraph:</text> 
<subparagraph><text>An offsets reserve, pursuant to paragraph (3).</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>Insurance that provides for purchase and provision to the Administrator for retirement of an amount of offset credits or emission allowances equal in number to the tons of carbon dioxide equivalents of greenhouse gas emissions released due to reversal.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>Another mechanism that the Administrator determines satisfies the requirements of this part.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Offsets reserve</header> 
<subparagraph><header>In general</header><text>An offsets reserve referred to in paragraph (2)(A) is a program under which, before issuance of offset credits under this part, the Administrator shall subtract and reserve from the quantity to be issued a quantity of offset credits based on the risk of reversal. The Administrator shall—</text> 
<clause><text>hold these reserved offset credits in the offsets reserve; and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>register the holding of the reserved offset credits in the Offset Registry established under section 732(d).</text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Project reversal</header> 
<clause><header>In general</header><text>If a reversal has occurred with respect to an offset project for which offset credits are reserved under this paragraph, the Administrator shall retire offset credits or emission allowances from the offsets reserve to fully account for the tons of carbon dioxide equivalent that are no longer sequestered.</text></clause> 
<clause><header>Intentional reversals</header><text>If the Administrator determines that a reversal was intentional, the offset project developer for the relevant offset project shall place into the offsets reserve a quantity of offset credits, or combination of offset credits and emission allowances, equal in number to the number of reserve offset credits that were canceled due to the reversal pursuant to clause (i). </text></clause> 
<clause><header>Unintentional reversals</header><text>If the Administrator determines that a reversal was unintentional, the offset project developer for the relevant offset project shall place into the offsets reserve a quantity of offset credits, or combination of offset credits and emission allowances, equal in number to half the number of offset credits that were reserved for that offset project, or half the number of reserve offset credits that were canceled due to the reversal pursuant to clause (i), whichever is less. </text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Use of reserved offset credits</header><text>Offset credits placed into the offsets reserve under this paragraph may not be used to comply with section 722.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection>

<paragraph><header>In general</header><text>For each offset project type, the Administrator shall specify a crediting period, and establish provisions for petitions for new crediting periods, in accordance with this subsection.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Duration</header><text>The crediting period shall be no less than 5 and no greater than 10 years for any project type other than those involving sequestration.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Eligibility</header><text>An offset project shall be eligible to generate offset credits under this part only during the project’s crediting period. During such crediting period, the project shall remain eligible to generate offset credits, subject to the methodologies and project type eligibility list that applied as of the date of project approval under section 735, except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Petition for new crediting period</header><text>An offset project developer may petition for a new crediting period to commence after termination of a crediting period, subject to the methodologies and project type eligibility list in effect at the time when such petition is submitted. A petition may not be submitted under this paragraph more than 18 months before the end of the pending crediting period. The Administrator may limit the number of new crediting periods available for projects of particular project types.</text></paragraph></subsection>

<subsection><header>Issuance</header> 
<paragraph><header>Regulations</header><text>Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this title, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, and any other appropriate Federal agency, and taking into consideration the recommendations of the Advisory Board, shall promulgate regulations for implementing this section. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the issuance of international offset credits under this section shall be subject to the requirements of this part. </text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Requirements for international offset credits</header><text>The Administrator may issue international offset credits only if—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>the United States is a party to a bilateral or multilateral agreement or arrangement that includes the country in which the project or measure achieving the relevant greenhouse gas emission reduction or avoidance, or greenhouse gas sequestration, has occurred;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>such country is a developing country; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>such agreement or arrangement—</text> 
<clause><text>ensures that the requirements of this part apply to the issuance of international offset credits under this section; and </text></clause> 
<clause><text>provides for the appropriate distribution of international offset credits issued.</text></clause></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Sector-based credits</header> 
<paragraph><header>In general</header><text>In order to minimize the potential for leakage and to encourage countries to take nationally appropriate mitigation actions to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions, or sequester greenhouse gases, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, shall—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>identify sectors of specific countries with respect to which the issuance of international offset credits on a sectoral basis is appropriate; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>issue international offset credits for such sectors only on a sectoral basis.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Identification of sectors</header> 
<subparagraph><header>General rule</header><text>For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), a sectoral basis shall be appropriate for activities—</text> 
<clause><text>in countries that have comparatively high greenhouse gas emissions, or comparatively greater levels of economic development; and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>that, if located in the United States, would be within a sector subject to the compliance obligation under section 722.</text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Factors</header><text>In determining the sectors and countries for which international offset credits should be awarded only on a sectoral basis, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, shall consider the following factors:</text> 
<clause><text>The country’s gross domestic product.</text></clause> 
<clause><text>The country’s total greenhouse gas emissions.</text></clause> 
<clause><text>Whether the comparable sector of the United States economy is covered by the compliance obligation under section 722.</text></clause> 
<clause><text>The heterogeneity or homogeneity of sources within the relevant sector.</text></clause> 
<clause><text>Whether the relevant sector provides products or services that are sold in internationally competitive markets.</text></clause> 
<clause><text>The risk of leakage if international offset credits were issued on a project-level basis, instead of on a sectoral basis, for activities within the relevant sector.</text></clause> 
<clause><text>The capability of accurately measuring, monitoring, reporting, and verifying the performance of sources across the relevant sector.</text></clause> 
<clause><text>Such other factors as the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, determines are appropriate to—</text> 
<subclause><text>ensure the integrity of the United States greenhouse gas emissions cap established under section 703; and</text></subclause> 
<subclause><text>encourage countries to take nationally appropriate mitigation actions to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions, or sequester greenhouse gases.</text></subclause></clause></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Sectoral basis</header> 
<subparagraph><header>Definition</header><text>In this subsection, the term <quote>sectoral basis</quote> means the issuance of international offset credits only for the quantity of sector-wide reductions or avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions, or sector-wide increases in sequestration of greenhouse gases, achieved across the relevant sector of the economy relative to a domestically enforceable baseline level of absolute emissions established in an agreement or arrangement described in subsection (b)(2)(A) for the sector.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Baseline</header><text>The baseline for a sector shall be established on an absolute basis and at levels of greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the thresholds identified in section 705(e)(2) and lower than would occur under a business-as-usual scenario taking into account relevant domestic or international policies or incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, among other factors, and additionality and performance shall be determined on the basis of such baseline.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Credits issued by an international body</header> 
<paragraph><header>In general</header><text>The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may issue international offset credits in exchange for instruments in the nature of offset credits that are issued by an international body established pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to a protocol to such Convention, or to a treaty that succeeds such Convention. The Administrator may issue international offset credits under this subsection only if, in addition to the requirements of subsection (b), the Administrator has determined that the international body that issued the instruments has implemented substantive and procedural requirements for the relevant project type that provide equal or greater assurance of the integrity of such instruments as is provided by the requirements of this part. Starting January 1, 2016, the Administrator shall issue no offset credit pursuant to this subsection if the activity generating the greenhouse gas emissions reductions or avoidance, or greenhouse gas sequestration, occurs in a country and sector identified by the Administrator under subsection (c).</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Retirement</header><text>The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall seek, by whatever means appropriate, including agreements, arrangements, or technical cooperation with the international issuing body described in paragraph (1), to ensure that such body—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>is notified of the Administrator’s issuance, under this subsection, of an international offset credit in exchange for an instrument issued by such international body; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>provides, to the extent feasible, for the disqualification of the instrument issued by such international body for subsequent use under any relevant foreign or international greenhouse gas regulatory program, regardless of whether such use is a sale, exchange, or submission to satisfy a compliance obligation.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection>

<section><header>Findings</header><text>Congress finds that—</text> 
<paragraph><text>as part of a global effort to mitigate climate change, it is in the national interest of the United States to assist developing countries to reduce and ultimately halt emissions from deforestation;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>deforestation is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries, amounting to roughly 20 percent of overall emissions globally;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>recent scientific analysis shows that it will be substantially more difficult to limit the increase in global temperatures to less than 2 degrees centigrade above preindustrial levels without reducing and ultimately halting net emissions from deforestation;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>reducing emissions from deforestation is highly cost-effective, compared to many other sources of emissions reductions;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>in addition to contributing significantly to worldwide efforts to address global warming, assistance under this part will generate significant environmental and social cobenefits, including protection of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and forest-related livelihoods; and</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>under the Bali Action Plan, developed country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the United States, committed to <quote>enhanced action on the provision of financial resources and investment to support action on mitigation and adaptation and technology cooperation,</quote> including, inter alia, consideration of <quote>improved access to adequate, predictable, and sustainable financial resources and financial and technical support, and the provision of new and additional resources, including official and concessional funding for developing country parties</quote> .</text></paragraph></section>

<subsection><header>In general</header><text>To the extent that auctions of emission allowances by the Administrator are authorized by this part, such auctions shall be carried out pursuant to this section and the regulations established hereunder.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Initial regulations</header><text>Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this title, the Administrator, in consultation with other agencies, as appropriate, shall promulgate regulations governing the auction of allowances under this section. Such regulations shall include the following requirements:</text> 
<paragraph><header>Frequency; first auction</header><text>Auctions shall be held four times per year at regular intervals, with the first auction to be held no later than March 31, 2011.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Auction schedule; current and future vintages</header><text>The Administrator shall, at each quarterly auction under this section, offer for sale both a portion of the allowances with the same vintage year as the year in which the auction is being conducted and a portion of the allowances with vintage years from future years. The preceding sentence shall not apply to auctions held before 2012, during which period, by necessity, the Administrator shall auction only allowances with a vintage year that is later than the year in which the auction is held. Beginning with the first auction and at each quarterly auction held thereafter, the Administrator may offer for sale allowances with vintage years of up to 4 years after the year in which the auction is being conducted, except as provided in section 782(p).</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Auction format</header><text>Auctions shall follow a single-round, sealed-bid, uniform price format.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Participation; financial assurance</header><text>Auctions shall be open to any person, except that the Administrator may establish financial assurance requirements to ensure that auction participants can and will perform on their bids.</text></paragraph>

<paragraph><header>Other requirements</header><text>The Administrator may include in the regulations such other requirements or provisions as the Administrator, in consultation with other agencies, as appropriate, considers appropriate to promote effective, efficient, transparent, and fair administration of auctions under this section.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Revision of regulations</header><text>The Administrator may, in consultation with other agencies, as appropriate, at any time, revise the initial regulations promulgated under subsection (b) by promulgating new regulations. Such revised regulations need not meet the requirements identified in subsection (b) if the Administrator determines that an alternative auction design would be more effective, taking into account factors including costs of administration, transparency, fairness, and risks of collusion or manipulation. In determining whether and how to revise the initial regulations under this subsection, the Administrator shall not consider maximization of revenues to the Federal Government.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Reserve auction price</header><text>The minimum reserve auction price shall be $10 (in constant 2009 dollars) for auctions occurring in 2012. The minimum reserve price for auctions occurring in years after 2012 shall be the minimum reserve auction price for the previous year increased by 5 percent plus the rate of inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers).</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Delegation or contract</header><text>Pursuant to regulations under this section, the Administrator may by delegation or contract provide for the conduct of auctions under the Administrator’s supervision by other departments or agencies of the Federal Government or by nongovernmental agencies, groups, or organizations.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Small business refiner reserve</header><text>The Administrator shall, in accordance with this subsection, issue regulations setting aside a specified number of allowances that small business refiners may purchase at the average auction price and may use to demonstrate compliance pursuant to section 722. These regulations shall provide the following:</text> 
<paragraph><header>Amount</header><text>The Administrator shall place in the small business refiner reserve account allowances that are to be sold at auction pursuant to the allocations in section 782 in an amount equal to—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>6.2 percent of the emission allowances established under section 721(a) for each vintage year from 2012 through 2013;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>5.4 percent of the emission allowances established under section 721(a) for each vintage year from 2014 through 2015; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>4.9 percent of the emission allowances established under section 721(a) for each vintage year from 2016 through 2024.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Allowed purchases</header><text>From January 1 of the calendar year that matches the vintage year for which allowances have been placed in the reserve, through January 14 of the following year, small business refiners (as defined in section 787(b)) may purchase allowances from this reserve at the price determined pursuant to paragraph (3).</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Price</header><text>The price for allowances purchased from this reserve shall be the average auction price for allowances of the same vintage year purchased at auctions conducted pursuant to this section during the 12 months preceding the purchase of the allowances.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Use of allowances</header><text>Allowances purchased from this reserve shall only be used by the purchaser to demonstrate compliance pursuant to section 722 for attributable greenhouse gas emissions in the calendar year that matches the vintage year of the purchased allowance. Allowances purchased from this reserve may not be banked, traded or borrowed.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Limitations on purchase amount</header><text>The Administrator, by regulation adopted after public notice and an opportunity for comment, shall establish procedures to distribute the ability to purchase allowances from the reserve fairly among all small business refiners interested in purchasing allowances from this reserve so as to address the potential that requests to purchase allowances exceed the number of allowances available in the reserve. This regulation may place limits on the number of allowances a small business refiner may purchase from the reserve.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Unsold allowances</header><text>Vintage year allowances not sold from the reserve on or before January 15 of the calendar year following the vintage year shall be sold at an auction conducted pursuant to this section no later than March 31 of the calendar year following the vintage year. If significantly more allowances are being placed in the reserve than are being purchased from the reserve several years in a row, the Administrator may adjust either the percent of allowances placed in the reserve or the date by which allowances may be purchased from the reserve. </text></paragraph></subsection></section> 
<section><header>Auctioning allowances for other entities</header> 
<subsection><header>Consignment</header><text>Any entity holding emission allowances or compensatory allowances may request that the Administrator auction, pursuant to section 791, the allowances on consignment.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Pricing</header><text>When the Administrator acts under this section as the agent of an entity in possession of emission allowances or compensatory allowances, the Administrator is not obligated to obtain the highest price possible for the allowances, and instead shall auction consignment allowances in the same manner and pursuant to the same rules as auctions of other allowances under section 791. The Administrator may permit the entity offering the allowance for sale to condition the sale of its allowances pursuant to this section on a minimum reserve price that is different than the reserve auction price set pursuant to section 791(d).</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Proceeds</header><text>For emission allowances and compensatory allowances auctioned pursuant to this section, notwithstanding  of title 31, United States Code, or any other provision of law, within 90 days of receipt, the United States shall transfer the proceeds from the auction to the entity which held the allowances auctioned. No funds transferred from a purchaser to a seller of emission allowances or compensatory allowances under this subsection shall be held by any officer or employee of the United States or treated for any purpose as public monies.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Unsold allowances</header><text>Allowances offered for sale under this section that are not sold shall be returned to the entity in possession of the allowance, notwithstanding section 726(b)(2)(A).</text></subsection>

<section><header>Standards of performance</header> 
<subsection><header>Uncapped stationary sources</header> 
<paragraph><header>Inventory of source categories</header> 
<subparagraph><text>Within 12 months after the date of enactment of this title, the Administrator shall publish under section 111(b)(1)(A) an inventory of categories of stationary sources that consist of those categories that contain sources that individually had uncapped greenhouse gas emissions greater than 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent and that, in the aggregate, were responsible for emitting at least 20 percent annually of the uncapped greenhouse gas emissions.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>The Administrator shall include in the inventory under this paragraph each source category that is responsible for at least 10 percent of the uncapped methane emissions in 2005. Notwithstanding any other provision, the inventory required by this section shall not include sources of enteric fermentation. The list under this paragraph shall include industrial sources, the emissions from which, when added to the capped emissions from industrial sources, constitute at least 95 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions of the industrial sector. </text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>For purposes of this subsection, emissions shall be calculated using tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. In promulgating the inventory required by this paragraph and the schedule required under by paragraph (2)(C), the Administrator shall use the most current emissions data available at the time of promulgation, except as provided in subparagraph (B).</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>Notwithstanding any other provisions, the Administrator may list under 111(b) any source category identified in the inventory required by this subsection without making a finding that the source category causes or contributes significantly to, air pollution with may be reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. </text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Standards and schedule</header> 
<subparagraph><text>For each category identified as provided in paragraph (1), the Administrator shall promulgate standards of performance under section 111 for the uncapped emissions of greenhouse gases from stationary sources in that category and shall promulgate corresponding regulations under section 111(d).</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>The Administrator shall promulgate standards as required by this subsection for stationary sources in categories identified as provided in paragraph (1) as expeditiously as practicable, assuring that—</text> 
<clause><text>standards for identified source categories that, combined, emitted 80 percent or more of the greenhouse gas emissions of the identified source categories shall be promulgated not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this title and shall include standards for natural gas extraction; and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>for all other identified source categories—</text> 
<subclause><text>standards for not less than an additional 25 percent of the identified categories shall be promulgated not later than 5 years after the date of enactment of this title;</text></subclause> 
<subclause><text>standards for not less than an additional 25 percent of the identified categories shall be promulgated not later than 7 years after the date of enactment of this title; and</text></subclause> 
<subclause><text>standards for all the identified categories shall be promulgated not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this title.</text></subclause></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>Not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of this title and after notice and opportunity for comment, the Administrator shall publish a schedule establishing a date for the promulgation of standards for each category of sources identified pursuant to paragraph (1). The date for each category shall be consistent with the requirements of subparagraph (B). The determination of priorities for the promulgation of standards pursuant to this paragraph is not a rulemaking and shall not be subject to judicial review, except that failure to promulgate any standard pursuant to the schedule established by this paragraph shall be subject to review under section 304(a)(2). </text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>Notwithstanding section 307, no action of the Administrator listing a source category under paragraph (1) shall be a final agency action subject to judicial review, except that any such action may be reviewed under section 307 when the Administrator issues performance standards for such category.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Capped sources</header><text>No standard of performance shall be established under section 111 for capped greenhouse gas emissions from a capped source unless the Administrator determines that such standards are appropriate because of effects that do not include climate change effects. In promulgating a standard of performance under section 111 for the emission from capped sources of any air pollutant that is not a greenhouse gas, the Administrator shall treat the emission of any greenhouse gas by those entities as a nonair quality public health and environmental impact within the meaning of section 111(a)(1).</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Performance standards</header><text>For purposes of setting a performance standard for source categories identified pursuant to subsection (a)—</text> 
<paragraph><text>The Administrator shall take into account the goal of reducing total United States greenhouse gas emissions as set forth in section 702.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>The Administrator may promulgate a design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or any combination thereof, under section 111 in lieu of a standard of performance under that section without regard to any determination of feasibility that would otherwise be required under section 111(h).</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Notwithstanding any other provision, in setting the level of each standard required by this section, the Administrator shall take into account projections of allowance prices, such that the marginal cost of compliance (expressed as dollars per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced) imposed by the standard would not, in the judgement of the Administrator, be expected to exceed the Administrator’s projected allowance prices over the time period spanning from the date of initial compliance to the date that the next revisions of the standard would come into effect pursuant to the schedule under section 111(b)(1)(B).</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Definitions</header><text>In this section, the terms <quote>uncapped greenhouse gas emissions</quote> and <quote>uncapped methane emissions</quote> mean those greenhouse gas or methane emissions, respectively, to which section 722 would not have applied if the requirements of this title had been in effect for the same year as the emissions data upon which the list is based.</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Study of the effects of performance standards</header> 
<paragraph><header>Study</header><text>The Administrator shall conduct a study of the impacts of performance standards required under this section, which shall evaluate the effect of such standards on the—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>costs of achieving compliance with the economy-wide reduction goals specified in section 702 and the reduction targets specified in section 703;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>available supply of offset credits; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>ability to achieve the economy-wide reduction goals specified in section 702 and any other benefits of such standards.</text></subparagraph></paragraph>

<clause><header>Basis of subsector determination</header><text>The Administrator shall determine an entity or group of entities to be a subsector of a six-digit section of the NAICS code based only upon the products manufactured and not the industrial process by which the products are manufactured, except that the Administrator may determine an entity or group of entities that manufacture a product from primarily virgin material to be a separate subsector from another entity or group of entities that manufacture the same product primarily from recycled material.</text></clause> 
<clause><header>Use of most recent data</header><text>In determining whether to designate a sector or subsector as an eligible industrial sector under this subparagraph, the Administrator shall use the most recent data available from the sources described in paragraph (2)(D), rather than the data from the years specified in paragraph (2)(D), to determine the trade intensity of such sector or subsector, but only for determining such trade intensity.</text></clause> 
<clause><header>Final action</header><text>The Administrator shall take final action on such petition no later than 6 months after the petition is received by the Administrator.</text></clause></subparagraph></paragraph> </subsection></section> 
<section><header>Distribution of emission allowance rebates</header> 
<subsection><header>Distribution schedule</header> 
<paragraph><header>In general</header><text>For each vintage year, the Administrator shall distribute pursuant to this section emission allowances made available under section 782(e), no later than October 31 of the preceding calendar year. The Administrator shall make such annual distributions to the owners and operators of each entity in an eligible industrial sector in the amount of emission allowances calculated under subsection (b), except that—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>for vintage years 2012 and 2013, the distribution for a covered entity shall be pursuant to the entity’s indirect carbon factor as calculated under subsection (b)(3);</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>for vintage year 2026 and thereafter, the distribution shall be pursuant to the amount calculated under subsection (b) multiplied by, except as modified by the President pursuant to section 767(d)(1)(C) for a sector—</text>

<clause><text>10 percent for vintage year 2034; and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>0 percent for vintage year 2035 and thereafter.</text></clause></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Resumption of reduction</header><text>If the President has modified the percentage stated in paragraph (1)(B) under section 767(d)(1)(C), and the President subsequently makes a determination under section 767(c) for an eligible industrial sector that more than 85 percent of United States imports for that sector are produced or manufactured in countries that have met at least one of the criteria in that section, then the 10-year reduction schedule set forth in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall begin in the next vintage year, with the percentage reduction based on the amount of the distribution of emission allowances under this section in the previous year. </text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Newly eligible sectors</header><text>In addition to receiving a distribution of emission allowances under this section in the first distribution occurring after an industrial sector is designated as eligible under section 763(b)(3), the owner or operator of an entity in that eligible industrial sector may receive a prorated share of any emission allowances made available for distribution under this section that were not distributed for the year in which the petition for eligibility was granted under section 763(b)(3)(A).</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Cessation of qualifying activities</header><text>If, as determined by the Administrator, a facility is no longer in an eligible industrial sector designated under section 763—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>the Administrator shall not distribute emission allowances to the owner or operator of such facility under this section; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>the owner or operator of such facility shall return to the Administrator all allowances that have been distributed to it for future vintage years and a pro-rated amount of allowances distributed to the facility under this section for the vintage year in which the facility ceases to be in an eligible industrial sector designated under section 763.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Calculation of direct and indirect carbon factors</header> 
<paragraph><header>In general</header> 
<subparagraph><header>Covered entities</header><text>Except as provided in subsection (a), for covered entities that are in eligible industrial sectors, the amount of emission allowance rebates shall be based on the sum of the covered entity’s direct and indirect carbon factors.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Other eligible entities</header><text>For entities that are in eligible industrial sectors but are not covered entities, the amount of emission allowance rebates shall be based on the entity’s indirect carbon factor.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>New entities</header><text>Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this title, the Administrator shall issue regulations governing the distribution of emission allowance rebates for the first and second years of operation of a new entity in an eligible industrial sector. These regulations shall provide for—</text> 
<clause><text>the distribution of emission allowance rebates to such entities based on comparable entities in the same sector; and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>an adjustment in the third and fourth years of operation to reconcile the total amount of emission allowance rebates received during the first and second years of operation to the amount the entity would have received during the first and second years of operation had the appropriate data been available.</text></clause></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Direct carbon factor</header><text>The direct carbon factor for a covered entity for a vintage year is the product of—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>the average annual output of the covered entity for the 2 years preceding the year of the distribution; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>the most recent calculation of the average direct greenhouse gas emissions (expressed in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) per unit of output for all covered entities in the sector, as determined by the Administrator under paragraph (4).</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Indirect carbon factor</header> 
<subparagraph><header>In general</header><text>The indirect carbon factor for an entity for a vintage year is the product obtained by multiplying the average annual output of the entity for the 2 years preceding the year of the distribution by both the electricity emissions intensity factor determined pursuant to subparagraph (B) and the electricity efficiency factor determined pursuant to subparagraph (C) for the year concerned.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Electricity emissions intensity factor</header> 
<clause><header>In general</header><text>Each person selling electricity to the owner or operator of an entity in any sector designated as an eligible industrial sector under section 763(b) shall provide the owner or operator of the entity and the Administrator, on an annual basis, the electricity emissions intensity factor for the entity. The electricity emissions intensity factor for the entity, expressed in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per kilowatt hour, is determined by dividing—</text> 
<subclause><text>the annual sum of the hourly product of—</text> 
<item><text>the electricity purchased by the entity from that person in each hour (expressed in kilowatt hours); multiplied by</text></item> 
<item><text>the marginal or weighted average tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt hour that are reflected in the electricity charges to the entity, as determined by the entity’s retail rate arrangements; by</text></item></subclause> 
<subclause><text>the total kilowatt hours of electricity purchased by the entity from that person during that year.</text></subclause></clause> 
<clause><header>Use of other data to determine factor</header><text>Where it is not possible to determine the precise electricity emissions intensity factor for an entity using the methodology in clause (i), the person selling electricity shall use the monthly average data reported by the Energy Information Administration or collected and reported by the Administrator for the utility serving the entity to determine the electricity emissions intensity factor.</text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Electricity efficiency factor</header><text>The electricity efficiency factor is the average amount of electricity (in kilowatt hours) used per unit of output for all entities in the relevant sector, as determined by the Administrator based on the best available data, including data provided under paragraph (6).</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Indirect carbon factor reduction</header><text>If an electricity provider received a free allocation of emission allowances pursuant to section 782(a), the Administrator shall adjust the indirect carbon factor to avoid rebates to the eligible entity for costs that the Administrator determines were not incurred by the eligible entity because the allowances were freely allocated to the eligible entity’s electricity provider and used for the benefit of industrial consumers.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Greenhouse gas intensity calculations</header><text>The Administrator shall calculate the average direct greenhouse gas emissions (expressed in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) per unit of output and the electricity efficiency factor for all covered entities in each eligible industrial sector every 4 years, using an average of the four most recent years of the best available data. For purposes of the lists required to be published no later than February 1, 2013, the Administrator shall use the best available data for the maximum number of years, up to 4 years, for which data are available. </text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Ensuring efficiency improvements</header><text>When making greenhouse gas calculations, the Administrator shall—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>limit the average direct greenhouse gas emissions per unit of output, calculated under paragraph (4), for any eligible industrial sector to an amount that is not greater than it was in any previous calculation under this subsection;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>limit the electricity emissions intensity factor, calculated under paragraph (3)(B) and resulting from a change in electricity supply, for any entity to an amount that is not greater than it was during any previous year; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>limit the electricity efficiency factor, calculated under paragraph (3)(C), for any eligible industrial sector to an amount that is not greater than it was in any previous calculation under this subsection.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Data sources</header><text>For the purposes of this subsection—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>the Administrator shall use data from the greenhouse gas registry established under section 713, where it is available; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>each owner or operator of an entity in an eligible industrial sector and each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United States shall provide the Administrator with such information as the Administrator finds necessary to determine the direct carbon factor and the indirect carbon factor for each entity subject to this section.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Total maximum distribution</header><text>Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), the Administrator shall not distribute more allowances for any vintage year pursuant to this section than are allocated for use under this subpart pursuant to section 782(e) for that vintage year. For any vintage year for which the total emission allowance rebates calculated pursuant to this section exceed the number of allowances allocated pursuant to section 782(e), the Administrator shall reduce each entity’s distribution on a pro rata basis so that the total distribution under this section equals the number of allowances allocated under section 782(e).</text></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Iron and steel sector</header><text>For purposes of this section, the Administrator shall consider as in different industrial sectors—</text>

<subtitle><header>Exporting Clean Technology</header> 
<section><header>Findings and purposes</header> 
<subsection><header>Findings</header><text>Congress finds the following:</text> 
<paragraph><text>Protecting Americans from the impacts of climate change requires global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Although developing countries are historically least responsible for the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change and continue to have very low per capita greenhouse gas emissions, their overall greenhouse gas emissions are increasing as they seek to grow their economies and reduce energy poverty for their populations.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Many developing countries lack the financial and technical resources to adopt clean energy technologies and absent assistance their greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Investments in clean energy technology cooperation can substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions while providing developing countries with incentives to adopt policies that will address competitiveness concerns related to regulation of United States greenhouse gas emissions.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Investments in clean technology in developing countries will increase demand for clean energy products, open up new markets for United States companies, spur innovation, and lower costs.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Under Article 4 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, developed country parties, including the United States, committed to <quote>take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate, and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other parties, particularly developing country parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention</quote>.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Under the Bali Action Plan, developed country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the United States, committed to <quote>enhanced action on the provision of financial resources and investment to support action on mitigation and adaptation and technology cooperation,</quote> including, inter alia, consideration of <quote>improved access to adequate, predictable, and sustainable financial resources and financial and technical support, and the provision of new and additional resources, including official and concessional funding for developing country parties</quote>.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Intellectual property rights are a key driver of investment and research and development in, and the global deployment of, clean technologies.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Innovative clean technologies, including U.S. and multilateral financing mechanisms for their deployment, are critical to mitigating global warming pollution, preventing catastrophic changes to the climate, and developing robust economies around the world.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Any weakening of intellectual property rights protection poses a substantial competitive risk to U.S. companies and the creation of high-quality U.S. jobs, inhibiting the creation of new <quote>green</quote> employment and the transformational shift to the <quote>Green Economy</quote> of the 21st Century.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Any U.S. funding directed toward assisting developing countries with regard to exporting clean technology should promote the robust compliance with and enforcement of existing international legal requirements for the protection of intellectual property rights as formulated in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, referred to in section 101(d)(15) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C.3511(d)(15) and in applicable intellectual property provisions of bilateral trade agreements.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Purposes</header><text>The purposes of this subtitle are—</text> 
<paragraph><text>to provide United States assistance and leverage private resources to encourage widespread implementation, in developing countries, of activities that reduce, sequester, or avoid greenhouse gas emissions; and</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>to provide such assistance in a manner that—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>encourages such countries to adopt policies and measures, including sector-based and cross-sector policies and measures, that substantially reduce, sequester, or avoid greenhouse gas emissions; </text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>promotes the successful negotiation of a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>promotes robust compliance with and enforcement of existing international legal requirements for the protection of intellectual property rights, as formulated in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights referred to in section 101(d)(15) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act () and in applicable intellectual property provisions of bilateral trade agreements.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection></section>

<part><header>International Climate Change Adaptation Program</header> 
<section><header>Findings and purposes</header> 
<subsection><header>Findings</header><text>Congress finds the following:</text> 
<paragraph><text>Global climate change is a potentially significant national and global security threat multiplier and is likely to exacerbate competition and conflict over agricultural, vegetative, marine, and water resources and to result in increased displacement of people, poverty, and hunger within developing countries.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>The strategic, social, political, economic, cultural, and environmental consequences of global climate change are likely to have disproportionate adverse impacts on developing countries, which have less economic capacity to respond to such impacts.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>The countries most vulnerable to climate change, due both to greater exposure to harmful impacts and to lower capacity to adapt, are developing countries with very low industrial greenhouse gas emissions that have contributed less to climate change than more affluent countries.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>To a much greater degree than developed countries, developing countries rely on the natural and environmental systems likely to be affected by climate change for sustenance, livelihoods, and economic growth and stability.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Within developing countries there may be varying climate change adaptation and resilience needs among different communities and populations, including impoverished communities, children, women, and indigenous peoples.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>The consequences of global climate change, including increases in poverty and destabilization of economies and societies, are likely to pose long-term challenges to the national security, foreign policy, and economic interests of the United States.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>It is in the national security, foreign policy, and economic interests of the United States to recognize, plan for, and mitigate the international strategic, social, political, cultural, environmental, health, and economic effects of climate change and to assist developing countries to increase their resilience to those effects.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Under Article 4 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, developed country parties, including the United States, committed to <quote>assist the developing country parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse effects</quote>.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>Under the Bali Action Plan, developed country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the United States, committed to <quote>enhanced action on the provision of financial resources and investment to support action on mitigation and adaptation and technology cooperation,</quote> including, inter alia, consideration of <quote>improved access to adequate, predictable, and sustainable financial resources and financial and technical support, and the provision of new and additional resources, including official and concessional funding for developing country parties</quote>.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Purposes</header><text>The purposes of this part are—</text> 
<paragraph><text>to provide new and additional assistance from the United States to the most vulnerable developing countries, including the most vulnerable communities and populations therein, in order to support the development and implementation of climate change adaptation programs and activities that reduce the vulnerability and increase the resilience of communities to climate change impacts, including impacts on water availability, agricultural productivity, flood risk, coastal resources, timing of seasons, biodiversity, economic livelihoods, health and diseases, and human migration; and</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><text>to provide such assistance in a manner that protects and promotes the national security, foreign policy, environmental, and economic interests of the United States to the extent such interests may be advanced by minimizing, averting, or increasing resilience to climate change impacts.</text></paragraph></subsection></section>

<section><header>Requirements for domestic agricultural and forestry practices</header> 
<subsection><header>Methodologies</header> 
<paragraph><header>In general; condition</header><text>In promulgating regulations under section 502, the Secretary shall establish methodologies for domestic agricultural and forestry practices listed under section 503, if the Secretary determines that methodologies can be established for such practices that meet each of the requirements of this section. The Secretary shall only issue offset credits under this title pursuant to promulgated methodologies applicable to the offset practice that avoided or reduced greenhouse gas emissions or sequestered greenhouse gases.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Specified methodologies</header><text>The Secretary shall establish the following methodologies under this section:</text> 
<subparagraph><header>Activity baselines</header><text>A standardized methodology for establishing activity baselines for an offset practice of that type. The Secretary shall set activity baselines to reflect a conservative estimate of performance or activities for the relevant type of practice (excluding changes in performance or activities due to the availability of offset credits) such that the baseline provides an adequate margin of safety to ensure the environmental integrity of offset credits calculated in reference to such baseline.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Additionality</header><text>A standardized methodology for determining the additionality of greenhouse gas emissions reduction or avoidance, or greenhouse gas sequestration, achieved by an offset practice of that type. Such methodology shall ensure, at a minimum, that any greenhouse gas emission reduction or avoidance, or any greenhouse gas sequestration, is considered additional only to the extent that it results from activities that—</text> 
<clause><text>are not required by existing government regulations, as determined by the Secretary; </text></clause> 
<clause><text>were not commenced prior to January 1, 2009, except in the case of—</text> 
<subclause><text>offset project activities that commenced after January 1, 2001, and were registered as of the date of enactment of this title under an offset program with respect to which an affirmative determination has been made under section 740 of the Clean Air Act; or </text></subclause> 
<subclause><text>activities that are readily reversible, with respect to which the Secretary may set an alternative earlier date under this subparagraph that is not earlier than January 1, 2001, where the Secretary determines that setting such an alternative date may produce an environmental benefit by removing an incentive to cease and then reinitiate activities that began prior to January 1, 2009; and</text></subclause></clause> 
<clause><text>exceed the applicable activity baseline established under paragraph (2).</text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Quantification methods</header><text>A standardized methodology for determining the extent to which greenhouse gas emission reductions or avoidance, or greenhouse gas sequestration, achieved by an offset practice of that type exceeded a relevant activity baseline, including methods for monitoring and accounting for uncertainty.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Leakage</header><text>A standardized methodology for accounting for and mitigating potential leakage, if any, from an offset practice of that type, taking uncertainty into account, excluding international indirect land use changes unless a positive determination is made under section 211(o)(13)(C)(iii) of the Clean Air Act.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Special considerations</header> 
<paragraph><header>Existing offset practices</header><text>In establishing the methodologies under subsection (a), the Secretary shall give due consideration to methodologies for offset practices existing as of the date of the enactment of this title.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Certain factors</header><text>As part of the methodologies established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall establish a formula that takes into account the components of the practice, the characteristics of the land on which the practice is applied, the crop produced, and such other factors as determined appropriate by the Secretary.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection><header>Accounting for reversals</header> 
<paragraph><header>In general</header><text>Except as provided in subsection (d) with respect to issuance of a term offset credit, for each type of practice listed under section 503, the Secretary shall establish requirements to account for and address reversals, including—</text> 
<subparagraph><text>a requirement to report any reversal with respect to an offset practice for which offset credits have been issued under this title;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>provisions to require emission allowances or offset credits to be held in amounts to fully compensate for greenhouse gas emissions attributable to reversals, and to assign responsibility for holding such emission allowances; and</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><text>any other provisions that the Secretary determines to be necessary to account for and address reversals.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Mechanisms</header> 
<subparagraph><header>In general</header><text>The Secretary shall prescribe mechanisms to ensure that any sequestration of greenhouse gases, with respect to which an offset credit is issued under this title, results in a permanent net increase in sequestration of greenhouse gases, and that full account is taken of any actual or potential reversal of such sequestration, with an adequate margin of safety.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Specific mechanisms</header><text>The Secretary shall make available one or more of the following mechanisms to meet the requirements of this paragraph:</text> 
<clause><text>An offsets reserve, pursuant to paragraph (3).</text></clause> 
<clause><text>Insurance that provides for purchase and provision to the Secretary for retirement of a quantity of offset credits or emission allowances equal in number to the tons of carbon dioxide equivalents of greenhouse gas emissions released due to reversal.</text></clause> 
<clause><text>Another mechanism if the Secretary determines it is necessary to satisfy the requirements of this title, taking into account whether the reversal was intentional or unintentional.</text></clause></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph><header>Offsets reserve</header> 
<subparagraph><header>In general</header><text>An offsets reserve referred to in paragraph (2)(B)(i) is a program under which, before issuance of offset credits under this title, the Secretary shall—</text> 
<clause><text>subtract and reserve from the quantity to be issued a quantity of offset credits based on the risk of reversal;</text></clause> 
<clause><text>hold those reserved offset credits in the offsets reserve; and</text></clause> 
<clause><text>register the holding of the reserved offset credits in an offset registry.</text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Practice reversal</header> 
<clause><header>In general</header><text>If a reversal has occurred with respect to an offset practice within an offset project, for which offset credits are reserved under this paragraph, the Secretary shall retire offset credits from the offsets reserve to fully account for the tons of carbon dioxide equivalent that are no longer sequestered.</text></clause> 
<clause><header>Intentional reversals</header><text>If the Secretary determines that a reversal was intentional, the offset practice developer for the relevant offset practice shall place into the offsets reserve a quantity of offset credits, or combination of offset credits and emission allowances, equal in number to the number of reserve offset credits that were retired pursuant to clause (i).</text></clause> 
<clause><header>Unintentional reversals</header><text>If the Secretary determines that a reversal was unintentional, the offset project developer for the relevant offset project shall place into the offsets reserve a quantity of offset credits, or combination of offset credits and emission allowances, equal in number to half the number of offset credits that were reserved for that offset project, or half the number of reserve offset credits that were canceled due to the reversal pursuant to clause (i), whichever is less, except that the Secretary may lower this amount based on undue hardship in the event of a catastrophic occurrence.</text></clause></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph><header>Use of reserved offset credits</header><text>Offset credits placed into the offsets reserve under this paragraph may not be used to comply with section 722 of the Clean Air Act. </text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection>
